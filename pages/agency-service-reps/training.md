## TSP to Retirement and Beyond Part I

This two-part presentation is most relevant for employees within 5-10 years of their planned retirement. The focus is on determining how much someone needs to save in their TSP account so they can retire at their desired standard of living with a nest egg that will last for the rest of their lives.

Part I includes a discussion on estimating future income needs, assessing the impact of long-term risks, deciding when to retire, and prioritizing retirement savings goals. (75 minutes)
