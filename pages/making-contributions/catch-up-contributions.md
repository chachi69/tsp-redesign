<h1><div class="nav-header">Catch-up contributions</div>Latest information</h1>

Updated **October 7, 2020**.

## Changes coming to catch-up contributions

Starting in January 2021, we’re making the process easier for participants. If you’re turning 50 or older and are eligible for catch-up, you’ll no longer need to make separate catch-up elections to your TSP account each year in order to take advantage of <span data-term="Catch-up contributions" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">catch-up contributions</span>, or &#8220;contributions toward the IRS catch-up limit.&#8221;

**Note: For 2020 catch-up contributions, you do still need to [complete the current process]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/contribution-types/) and make a separate election.** Check [current contribution limits]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/contribution-limits/) to make sure you’re on track this year.

## Here’s how it will work

- Next year, if you’re turning 50 or older and exceed the IRS elective deferral (or annual addition) limit, then your contributions will automatically start counting toward the IRS catch-up limit.<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup> Just add any contributions toward the catch-up limit in the same place as your other TSP contributions.

- Your election will carry over each year unless you submit a new one. For instructions on submitting a new election, see [Start, change, or stop contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/).

- If you’re eligible for an agency or service match, contributions spilling over toward the catch-up limit will qualify for the match<sup>[2](#footnotes)</sup> on up to 5% of your salary.<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup>

- You may [start, stop, or change your contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/) at any time. If you choose not to contribute toward the catch-up limit, you should adjust your TSP contributions accordingly.

## Important note for members of the uniformed services

If you are a uniformed services member and enter a combat zone, your contributions toward the catch-up limit must be Roth. (The TSP cannot accept traditional tax-exempt contributions toward the catch-up limit.) You also cannot contribute toward the catch-up limit from incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay.

If you are contributing to both a civilian and uniformed services account, the limits apply to the total you contribute to both accounts during the year.

## Dates of upcoming webinars and trainings

We will continue to update this page as the dates of upcoming webinars and trainings are coming soon.

## Additional information and resources

We will continue to update this page as additional information and resources are coming soon.

1. For 2020, eligible participants should complete [Form TSP-1-C]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-1-c.pdf) (<span class="nobr">[TSP-U-1-C]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-u-1-c.pdf)</span> for uniformed services members) or use your payroll system’s &#8220;catch-up&#8221; option. Also, 2020 catch-up contributions aren’t matched.
2. For Blended Retirement System (BRS) participants: If you have reached the annual addition limit, your contributions toward catch-up will not be matched. (The IRS does not allow participants who have reached the annual addition limit to receive any more matching for the year.)
