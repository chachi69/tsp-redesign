The TSP supports [America Saves Week]({{ site.baseurl }}//exit/?idx=302){:rel="nofollow"} and [Military Saves Week]({{ site.baseurl }}//exit/?idx=303){:rel="nofollow"} both of which begin February 19 and continue through February 26, 2012. Both campaigns focus on encouraging individuals and families to reduce debt and save and invest for both short and long term financial goals including retirement. See [Bulletin 12-U-4]({{ site.baseurl }}/bulletins/12-u-4.pdf) that addresses the week-long event and the TSP's support of it. A special poster highlighting the upcoming Roth TSP, "A New Way to Save," is attached to the bulletin and available to all federal agencies for distribution and posting.
