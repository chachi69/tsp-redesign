We are replacing Forms TSP-U-9, Change in Address for Separated Participant, and TSP-U-15, Change in Name for Separated Participant, with the 6/2008 versions of Forms TSP-9 and TSP-15. We are also reinstating the documentation requirement for Form TSP-15. **The new Forms TSP-9 and TSP-15 are intended for use by both members of the uniformed services and civilians**. The primary change is that both forms are designed to be read by an optical scanner. Therefore, Forms TSP-U-9 and TSP-U-15 are now obsolete and should be discarded. These forms are intended for use only by separated participants. We have posted the new forms on the TSP Web site and are directing participants who click on links to them to messages explaining the change. (Please see Bulletins 09-U-5 and 09-U-6.)
