The Thrift Savings Plan has created a new video called “[The TSP for BRS Members: What’s It All About?]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=41){:rel="nofollow"}” to give an overview of the Thrift Savings Plan to uniformed services members covered by the new Blended Retirement System (BRS). Beginning January 1, 2018, all new members of the uniformed services will be enrolled in BRS. Members with fewer than 12 years of service by December 31, 2017, are also eligible to enroll in the new system.

The Thrift Savings Plan created a second new video called “[The TSP for Non-BRS Members: What’s It All About?]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=42){:rel="nofollow"} ” Along with the new video for members covered by Blended Retirement System (BRS), this video replaces the “The TSP: What’s It All About (Uniformed Services),” which was posted on 7/30/13. It provides an overview of the TSP for those who were not eligible or chose not to opt into BRS.

Those who are eligible for BRS and have not decided whether to join should see the video “[Opting into the Blended Retirement System (BRS)]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=35){:rel="nofollow"} ” and the fact sheet Questions and Answers about Opting into the Blended Retirement System (BRS). The new video and others designed to educate members on the TSP can be found at [youtube.com/tsp4gov]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=43){:rel="nofollow"} .
