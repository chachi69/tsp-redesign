# Court Appointments
 
A guardian or conservator has a court-ordered authority to act for a participant or beneficiary who is deemed incapacitated or incompetent.
 
If we receive a qualifying court order authorizing another individual to act on a participant (or beneficiary's) behalf,  we will not accept any documents signed by the participant (or beneficiary) after the date of that court order.
 
Read Court Orders and Powers of Attorney, which explains the rules for establishing a guardianship or conservatorship.
