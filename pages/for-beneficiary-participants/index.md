# For beneficiary participants

## Reporting a participantâ€™s death


If you are the next-of-kin or legal representative of a deceased TSP participant, you should notify us __immediately__ in the event of their death. You can do this in one of three ways:

+ If the participant was an active federal employee or member of the uniformed services, report the death to the participant's employing agency or service.
+ Report the participant's death to us by calling 1-877-968-3778. Press 3 from the main menu to speak to a Participant Service Representative.
+ Read, complete, and submit [Information Relating to Deceased Participant](/forms/tsp-17.pdf), *Form TSP-17*, along with the participant's certified death certificate.
