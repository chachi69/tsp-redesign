  The L 2020 is designed for you if your time horizons falls within the 2019 through 2024 range. The asset allocation of this fund is adjusted quarterly, moving to a more conservative mix, gradually approaching that of the L Income Fund. Between quarterly adjustments, the asset allocation of the L 2020 is maintained through daily rebalancing to the fund’s target allocation.

  Remember, however, that expected risk and return are based on assumptions about future economic conditions and investment performance. There is no guaranteed rate of return for any period, either short-term or long-term. For the fund’s historical returns, visit [Share Price History](/fund-performance/share-price-history/). Past performance does not guarantee future results.
