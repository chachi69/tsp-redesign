We learned from OPM that it will be moving to a two character, alphanumeric retirement code. OPM is still in the process of finalizing the specific coding scheme and hopes to publish the new codes by the end of the month. The TSP will program fields 239 and 240 of its Employee data (06) records to accept these new codes. If OPM keeps the existing codes and simply adds new codes for FERS-Revised Annuity Employees, the TSP will continue to use field 227 for currently existing codes. Agencies should prepare to submit the new codes to the TSP with their first payroll submissions in January 2013. The TSP will issue a bulletin explaining the changes in greater detail once OPM publishes its coding scheme. The TSP will also amend its reports to reflect the new codes. As always, once the updates to the TSP data record and corresponding reports is complete, agency payroll offices may contact ATS to coordinate the submission of their test files.
