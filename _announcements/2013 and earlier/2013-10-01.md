To answer questions about TSP participation in the event of a Federal Government shutdown, the TSP has published the fact sheet, [Impact of a Government Shutdown on the Thrift Savings Plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/bulletins/oc11-05.pdf){:.pdf}. The fact sheet also emphasizes that agencies and services should not submit Form TSP-41, Notification to TSP of Nonpay Status, in the event that a government shutdown should occur.
