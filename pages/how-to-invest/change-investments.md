# Change your investments

To change which fund(s) you invest in, there are two transactions you can make:

<p markdown="1">A **<span data-term="Contribution Allocation" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">contribution allocation</span>** tells us how you want to invest NEW money coming into your account.</p>

<p markdown="1">An **<span data-term="Interfund Transfer (IFT)" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">interfund transfer (IFT)</span>** allows you to change the way money ALREADY in your account is invested.</p>

You are allowed two IFTs in a calendar month. After that, you can only transfer money into the G Fund.

You may request a contribution allocation or an IFT by visiting [Online Transactions](#). You can also call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and follow the automated prompts.
