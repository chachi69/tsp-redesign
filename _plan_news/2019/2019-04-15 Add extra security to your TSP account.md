**Add extra security to your TSP account** &#8212; You’re now able to make online access to your TSP account even more secure by enabling two-step authentication at login. This means that you’ll receive a one-time verification code by email or text message each time you log into your account. To add this security feature, log into My Account on tsp.gov and go to your profile settings.

Enabling two-step authentication helps you protect your account against fraud. This login process is more secure because it means that online access to your account requires something you know (your account number or username and password) and something you have (the one-time code you receive in your email or on your phone). Someone who tries to log into your account fraudulently won’t be able to gain access without the code.

Before you can use two-step authentication, you must first validate an email address or cell phone. You can validate your contact information in your My Account profile settings.
