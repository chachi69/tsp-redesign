# System of Records Notices (SORNs)

The Privacy Act of 1974 requires all federal agencies to publish a formal notice to the public in the Federal Register that identifies the purposes for which personally identifiable information (PII) is collected; how the PII is used by the Agency; how the Agency shares PII externally; and, most importantly, how individuals can access and correct the information a federal government agency maintains on the subject individual. These notices are called System of Records Notices (SORNs).

FRTIB is required to publish a SORN anytime it creates, substantially modifies, or retires a system of records. A system of records is a collection of records under the control of a federal agency from which information about a specific individual can be retrieved or accessed by a unique personal identifier (e.g., name or account number).

## FRTIB has the following systems of records:

  **Summary of Purpose**
  Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is proposing to modify its system of records for fraud and forgery records. Records contained in this system are used to investigate potential or actual fraud against TSP participant or beneficiary accounts. FRTIB is modifying this system of records to account for its process for addressing new alerts the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) sends to FRTIB to better help protect and secure participant account information.

  **DATES:**
  This system will become effective upon its publication in today’s Federal Register. FRTIB is not proposing any changes to the routine uses.

  **ADDRESSES:**
  You may submit written comments to FRTIB by any one of the following methods:
  - _Federal [eRulemaking Portal]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=145)._ Follow the website instructions for submitting comments.
  - _Fax_: (202) 942-1676.
  - _Mail or Hand Delivery:_ Office of General Counsel, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street NE, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002.

  **FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:**
  Marla Greenberg, Chief Privacy Officer, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, Office of General Counsel, 77 K Street NE, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002, (202) 942-1600. For access to any of the FRTIB’s system of records, contact Amanda Haas, FOIA Officer, Office of General Counsel, at the above address and phone number.

  **SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:**
  FRTIB is proposing to modify its system of records for fraud and forgery records, entitled, “FRTIB-13, Fraud and Forgery Records.” The proposed changes are necessary because they enable the FRTIB to protect participant accounts based on additional information FRTIB receives from the FS-ISAC, concerning account credentials that may have been compromised. FRTIB is proposing to amend the purpose of the system of records to provide additional context around how the Agency protects participant accounts from fraudulent activity. FRTIB is proposing to change the categories of individuals covered by the system, to include information about participants and beneficiaries who may be actual or potential victims of fraud.

  Additionally, FRTIB is proposing to modify the category of records in the system to include telephone numbers, IP addresses, and notifications from FS-ISAC, which includes potentially or actually compromised credentials participants use to log into their TSP account online. FRTIB is also proposing a change to record source categories to include FS-ISAC. Finally, FRTIB is proposing technical and clarifying language to conform to the standards established in OMB Circular A-108, but these changes are not substantive in nature. FRTIB is not proposing modifications to its routine uses or exemptions claimed.

    FRTIB-21  | Identity, Credential and Access Management (ICAM)
  </button>
  <div id="a21" class="usa-accordion-content" markdown="1">

  **Federal Register** [84 FR 43600 (Aug. 21, 2019))]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=128).

  **SUMMARY**: Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) proposes to establish a new system of records. Records contained in this system will be used to implement Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) capabilities at the Agency. ICAM manages digital identities, credentials, and access controls for FRTIB applications and systems.

  **DATES**: This system will become effective upon its publication in today’s Federal Register, with the exception of the routine uses which will be effective on September 20, 2019. FRTIB invites written comments on the routine uses and other aspects of this system of records. Submit any comments by September 20, 2019.

  **ADDRESSES**: You may submit written comments to FRTIB by any one of the following methods:

  * _Federal eRulemaking Portal_: [https://www.regulations.gov]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=145). Follow the website instructions for submitting comments.
  * _Fax_: (202) 942-1676.
  * _Mail or Hand Delivery_: Office of General Counsel, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street NE, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002.

  **FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT**: Marla Greenberg, Chief Privacy Officer, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, Office of General Counsel, 77 K Street NE, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002, (202) 942-1600. For access to any of the FRTIB’s systems of records, contact Amanda Haas, FOIA Officer, Office of General Counsel, at the above address and phone number.

  **SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION**: FRTIB proposes to establish a new system of records entitled, &#8220;FRTIB-21, Identity, Credential and Access Management (ICAM).&#8221; ICAM manages digital identities, credentials, and access controls for FRTIB applications and systems. ICAM is necessary to vet potential users; link employees and contractors to digital identity accounts; provision and de-provision accounts and access; and to monitor identity credentials, access to systems and data, and related risks. The proposed system of records implements ICAM capabilities across all FRTIB IT systems.

  ICAM supports the following seven key functions of the ICAM Framework as defined by the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council: digital identity, credentialing, authentication, cryptography, auditing and reporting, authorization and access, and privilege management. FRTIB’s ICAM’s capabilities are also aligned with the Federal CIO Council’s Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) procedures, available at, [https://www.idmanagement.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/1171/uploads/FICAM_Roadmap_and_Implem_Guid.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=169){:rel="nofollow"}.

  FRTIB proposes to apply thirteen routine uses to FRTIB-21.

  **Megan Grumbine**,  
  _General Counsel and Senior Agency Official for Privacy_

  **SYSTEM NAME AND NUMBER**: FRTIB-21, Identity, Credential and Access Management (ICAM).

  **SECURITY CLASSIFICATION**: Unclassified.

  **SYSTEM LOCATION**: Records are located at the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street NE, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. Records may also be maintained at additional locations for Business Continuity purposes.

  **SYSTEM MANAGER**: Director, Office of Technology Services, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street NE, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002, 202-942-1600.

  **AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM**: [5 U.S.C. 8474]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=157); and 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

  **PURPOSE(S) OF THE SYSTEM**: ICAM employs a comprehensive management approach for digital identities and associated attributes, credentials (including PKI, PIV, other authentication tokens), and access controls. It centralizes a consistent, integrated method for managing the identities of individuals and devices requiring logical access and for enforcing logical access privileges to FRTIB resources for all FRTIB employees and contractors.

  ICAM protects FRTIB information and systems by ensuring that only the appropriate users have access to information systems, personally identifiable information (PII), and other sensitive data based on the principles of least privilege and need-to-know. ICAM manages the identities of individuals that access FRTIB logical resources, authorizes users’ permissions, enforces access controls for IT systems and information, and audits access to and the use of sensitive information and functions.

  **CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM**: FRTIB employees and contractors.

  **CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM**: Records in this system include: first name, middle name, last name, personal phone number, personal e-mail address, social security number, date of birth, place of birth, current address, business address, business e-mail address, business phone number, employment information (e.g., employment type, manager status, domain administrator status, hire date, contract end date), user name, user name creation date, IP address, background investigation data including Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) review and release date, fingerprint submission and completion date, OPM investigation type, investigation review and completion date, PIV card information, completion date for required training, and completion date for required documentation (e.g., rules of behavior, non-disclosure agreement).
