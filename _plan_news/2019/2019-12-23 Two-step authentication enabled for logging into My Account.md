**Two-step authentication enabled for logging into My Account** &#8212; All TSP participants now must have validated contact information and use two-step authentication to log into My Account.

Two-step authentication helps protect your account against fraud. This login process is more secure because it means that online access to your account requires something you know (your account number or user ID and password) and something you have (the one-time code you receive in your email or on your phone). Someone who tries to log into your account fraudulently won’t be able to gain access without the code.

If you’re having trouble logging in, you can read our [tips and troubleshooting guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/account-basics/troubleshoot-login-errors/).
