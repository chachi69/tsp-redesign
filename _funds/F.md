Fund_objective_short: To match the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.
questions:
  - question: Why should I invest in the F Fund?
    answer: F Fund investors are rewarded with the opportunity to earn higher rates of return over the long term than they would from investments in short-term securities such as the G Fund. The overall risk is relatively low in comparison to certain other fixed income investments in the market because the F Fund includes only investment-grade securities.
  - question: Am I ok with market and inflation risk?
    answer: F Fund returns move up and down with the returns in the bond market (market risk). F Fund investors are also exposed to the possibility that principal and interest payments on the bonds that comprise the index will not be paid (credit default risk) or if F Fund investments do not grow enough to offset the reduction in purchasing power (inflation risk). Your F Fund investment is also exposed to prepayment risk, which is the probability that if interest rates fall, bonds that are represented in the index will be paid back early thus forcing lenders to reinvest at lower rates.
  - question: How can I use the F Fund in my TSP?
    answer: In periods of falling interest rates, the F Fund will experience gains from the resulting rise in bond prices. So in the long run, you may expect F Fund returns to exceed those of the G Fund; however, you should also expect greater price volatility (up and down movements). A retirement portfolio that contains stock funds, like the C, S, and I Funds, along with the F Fund, will tend to be less volatile than one that contains stock funds alone.

additional_info: |
  By law, the F Fund must be invested in fixed-income securities. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board has chosen to invest the F Fund in an index fund that tracks the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, a broadly diversified index of the U.S. bond market.

  The U.S. Aggregate Index consists of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities of more than one year. Because the U.S. Aggregate Index contains such a large number of securities, it is not feasible for the F Fund to invest in each security in the index.

  The F Fund is invested in a separate account that is managed by BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. BlackRock selects a large representative sample of the various types of asset-backed, U.S. government, corporate, and foreign government securities included in the overall index. The performance of the F Fund is evaluated on the basis of how closely its returns match those of the U.S. Aggregate Index.

risk_level: low-medium
