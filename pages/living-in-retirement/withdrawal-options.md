# Withdrawal Options

You have two options for withdrawing your TSP account after you leave federal service.

## Partial withdrawals

A partial withdrawal allows you to make a one-time-only withdrawal and leave the rest of your money in your TSP account until a later date.
Use [Form TSP-77](#), *Request for Partial Withdrawal When Separated*, which is also available through the ThriftLine.

You can make a partial withdrawal if::
+ You have not made a prior partial withdrawal or have one that is currently pending, and
+ You did not make an age-based in-service withdrawal while you were still employed by the federal government or the uniformed services, and
+ You request $1,000 or more from your account.

## Full withdrawals
When you’re ready to withdraw all of the money from your TSP account, you can do it all at once, over a period of time, or you can purchase an annuity that will make payments to you for life. You can also choose any combination of these full withdrawal options.

### Full withdrawal as a single payment
Choose the single payment option (also referred to as a “lump sum” payment) if you want to withdraw your entire account at one time.

### Full Withdrawal as a series of monthly payments
Choose monthly payments if you want to withdraw your entire account in a series of payments spread over time. We offer two choices of monthly payments:
Specific dollar amount. You may request a specific dollar amount that you will receive each month until your entire TSP account has been paid out to you. The amount you request must be $25 or more.
Life expectancy. You may request to have us calculate your monthly payment for you using the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Life Expectancy Tables. Your first payment amount will be based on your age and your account balance at the time of the first payment. We will recalculate your monthly payment every year.
Our [Retirement Income Calculator](#) will help you decide whether receiving monthly income is right for you by comparing the available options and features that might meet your needs. If you’re currently receiving monthly payments and you want to do some calculations to choose a different payment amount, use the [Monthly Payment Calculator](#).

### Full withdrawal as a life annuity
A life annuity is a monthly benefit paid to you for life. You can withdraw all or part of your TSP account as a life annuity as long as the amount used to purchase it is $3,500 or more. If you have both a traditional and a Roth balance, the $3,500 minimum threshold applies to each balance separately. We will purchase your annuity(ies) for you from its provider. To learn more about the annuity options available to you, visit [Annuity basics](#).

### Full withdrawal as a combination of options
You can withdraw your entire account balance using a combination of any of the available full withdrawal options (single payment, monthly payments, or life annuity).
