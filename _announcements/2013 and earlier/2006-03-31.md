**TSP Loan Default Program** &#8212; The TSP implemented the final phase of the loan default program required by the Internal Revenue Service. The TSP has mailed notices to those participants whose loans are missing two-and-a-half or more payments, notifying them that the loans have beenreamortized. Although their loan payments have not been changed, the terms of the loan have been extended and, in somecases, a balloon payment atthe end ofthe term may be requiredunless additional payments are made.
