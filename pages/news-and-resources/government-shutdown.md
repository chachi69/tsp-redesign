# Government shutdown

## TSP operations during a lapse in appropriations (government shutdown)

The TSP will continue its normal daily operations during the current lapse in appropriations. If you currently have a TSP loan, note that if the lapse in appropriations is short enough that you donâ€™t miss a paycheck, then you do not need to take any action or submit any documentation at this time. If the lapse in appropriations lasts long enough that you miss a paycheck, this may change. You always have the option of sending a TSP loan payment directly to the TSP.  If you do so, use the [Loan Coupon]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-26/).

We will provide more instruction if the lapse in appropriations continues. You can check this announcement page or [tsp.gov/shutdown]({{ site.baseurl }}/news-and-resources/government-shutdown/) for updates.

You can read our fact sheet [_Frequently Asked Questions About TSP Loans During a Lapse in Appropriations_]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspfs13.pdf) about what to do if you are on shutdown furlough and have an existing TSP loan or are considering taking a TSP loan during the lapse in appropriations.
