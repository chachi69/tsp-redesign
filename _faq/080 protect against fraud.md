Private parties offering assistance with your TSP account have not been approved, endorsed, sponsored, or authorized by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, the independent federal government agency that administers the TSP.

If youâ€™re unsure whether correspondence or telephone calls claiming to be from the TSP are authentic, **DO NOT** provide any personal or financial information. Contact us directly at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to speak to a Participant Service Representative if you have questions or if you need to report any suspicious activity involving your TSP account.
