The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board has issued interim regulations that allow the Executive Director to adopt a policy of setting limits on the number of interfund transfers requests. In the near term, this interim regulation allows the Executive Director to immediately address and, if necessary, restrict the activity of frequent traders, who have disrupted management of the TSP Funds and whose activity has resulted in increased costs to all participants. This interim rule is effective January 7, 2008. For more information about frequent trading, see the Questions and Answers on the TSP Web site Home page.

**I.R.C. Section 402(g) Limit** &#8220; The elective deferral limit for 2008 remains $15,500. This limit applies to tax-deferred employee contributions. If employee contributions are also made to a civilian TSP account, the total of the tax-deferred employee contributions cannot exceed this limit.

**Catch-Up Contributions** &#8220; The limit on catch-up contributions for 2008 is $5,000. Eligible employees must make new elections for catch-up contributions each calendar year.

**I.R.C. Section 415(c) Limit** &#8220; The limit for 2008 is $46,000. This limit applies to all TSP contributions, including tax-exempt contributions. If contributions are also made to a civilian TSP account, the total of all contributions cannot exceed this limit.
