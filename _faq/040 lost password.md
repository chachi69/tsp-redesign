If you forget, lose, or want to change your TSP account password, you’ve got a few options.

If you forget or lose your password, go to the My Account section of tsp.gov, click on “Forgot your password?” and follow the prompts. If you know your password and want to change it, log in to [My Account: Profile Settings]({{ site.profile_settings }}){:target="\_blank"} and click on “Change Your Password.” You can also call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and press option 3 to speak to a Participant Service Representative.
