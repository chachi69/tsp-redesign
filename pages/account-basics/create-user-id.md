# Create a user ID on tsp.gov

You must create a user ID to log in securely to My Account and manage your Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account online. If you previously created a user ID and can’t remember it, you may be able to follow prompts to recover your user ID online.

**Note**: You need your **TSP account number** and **web password** to create your user ID.

### Two-step authentication
{:.usa-alert-heading}

If you’ve logged in to My Account previously and set up a validated phone number, you’ll see a prompt to complete two-step authentication by receiving a one-time code by text or phone call

</div>
</div>


When you log in to your TSP account for the first time, you will add and validate a phone number in order to use <span data-term="Two-step authentication" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">two-step authentication</span> and add other profile information for additional account security.
