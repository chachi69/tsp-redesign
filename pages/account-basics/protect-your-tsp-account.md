# Protect your TSP account

As a TSP participant, you should know how to protect your account against various types of fraud. Private parties offering assistance with your TSP account, including third party mobile apps, have not been approved, endorsed, sponsored, or authorized by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which is the independent government agency that administers the TSP.

## How to block access to your TSP account

If you find it necessary to block online access to your TSP account, you can do so by going to [My Account: Block Online/ThriftLine Access](#) or by calling the [ThriftLine](#) and speaking with a Participant Services Representative.

To reinstate online access to your account, [send a written request](#) and specify which block(s) you want removed (website, ThriftLine, or both). You must sign and date the request, but it does not need to be notarized. You will not be able to make your request online or by calling the ThriftLine.
