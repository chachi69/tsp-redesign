# Government shutdown

## Loans during a lapse in appropriations

As a result of the recent partial government shutdown, we made changes to provide assistance to affected TSP participants. In the event your agency is affected by a lapse in appropriations, read the fact sheet [_Frequently Asked Questions About TSP Loans During a Lapse in Appropriations_]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspfs13.pdf) for details on how to take a loan, what to do if a lapse in appropriations lasts long enough to affect your loan payments, and other questions you may have about taking or having a loan while you are on shutdown furlough. The fact sheet also explains what happens with your loan payments when a lapse in appropriations ends.

## Making loan payments after the Government shutdown

Due to limitations of employing agency/service payroll systems, some payroll offices may not be able to deduct loan payments from back pay. **If your loan payments havenâ€™t been taken out of back pay, you should submit your loan payments directly to the TSP using the [Loan Payment Coupon]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-26/).** You can always check the status of your loan by logging into [My Account]({{ site.myaccount }}), selecting &#8220;TSP Loans,&#8221; and then selecting &#8220;Are my payments up to date?&#8220; Or you can call the ThriftLine at <span class="nobr">1-877-968-3778</span> and speak to a Participant Service Representative.

## Government shutdown and loan payments

The TSP allows for the suspension of loan payments when you go into nonpay status to prevent your loan from going into default. Normally, we require documentation from your agency or service. However, the **TSP does not need documentation of your furlough at this time.** If your loan payments were up to date prior to the furlough, missing one or two payments will not cause your loan to be in default. You can check the status of your loan by logging into My Account, selecting &#8220;TSP Loans,&#8221; and then selecting &#8220;Are my payments up to date?&#8221; Or you can call the ThriftLine at <span class="nobr">1-877-968-3778</span> and speak to a Participant Service Representative.

As long as retroactive pay is approved, all missed loan payments will be submitted and posted to your loan. We will provide more information as the furlough continues or as events change.
