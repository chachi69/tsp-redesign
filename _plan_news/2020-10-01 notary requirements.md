**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; As of October 1, 2020, TSP forms that require notarized signatures must be signed and notarized. We accept electronic and remote notarization in addition to traditional, in-person notarization. All signatures must be handwritten or made electronically with PIV or CAC credentials.

Earlier this year, we temporarily waived notarization requirements in order to support participants in physical distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. With electronic and remote options in place, weâ€™re reinstating these notarization requirements as an important security measure against attempts at fraud.
