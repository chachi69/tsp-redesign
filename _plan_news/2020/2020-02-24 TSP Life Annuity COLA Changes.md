**TSP Life Annuity COLA Changes to Flat 2% in March** &#8212; The cost of living adjustment (COLA) applied to TSP life annuities with the increasing payments feature will become a flat 2% beginning with annuities purchased on or after March 2, 2020. Annual adjustments for TSP annuities purchased before then will continue to vary between 0% and 3% depending on the Consumer Price Index. Annual adjustments for all TSP annuities take place on the anniversary of the first payment. TSP life annuities are purchased from the TSP’s outside vendor, using money from your TSP account. The information provided here is not related to the “basic annuity” or “pension” that is part of retirement coverage under FERS or CSRS, or the military retired pay that members of the uniformed services receive.
