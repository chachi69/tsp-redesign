**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; If the state in which you reside has extended notary commissions as a result of the pandemic, you must include information about the extension with any TSP forms you notarize. You may include this information as an annotation or as supporting documentation from your state. We will not be able to process forms that have been notarized with an expired commission unless you include an annotation or provide supporting documentation.
