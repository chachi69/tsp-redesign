# Access your account


## What you'll need to gain access to your TSP account

When you become a TSP participant, you will receive:

+ A TSP account number - the primary means of identifying your account. Once you have logged into your account on the website, you can create a customized user ID to use instead of your account number for web transactions;
+ A web password to access your account on the website; and
+ A Personal Identification Number (PIN), which you will use to access your account on the ThriftLine (1-877-968-3778).

After you log into your TSP account for the first time, you can go to your profile settings to validate an email address and cell phone. Then you can enable two-step authentication. 

Two-step authentication helps you protect your account against fraud by prompting you for a one-time verification code each time you log in. This login process is more secure because it means that online access to your account requires something you know (your account number or username and password) and something you have (a one-time verification code you receive in your email or on your phone). Someone who tries to log into your account fraudulently wonâ€™t be able to gain access without the code.


## Keep your account information safe

The security of your account number (or user ID), web password and ThriftLine PIN is critical to safeguarding the assets in your TSP account. The TSP is not responsible for any activity in your account transacted by someone who has access to these numbers. Remember to:
+ Memorize them.
+ Validate your contact information.
+ Enable two-step authentication in your My Account profile settings.
+ Never give out these sensitive numbers, and never leave your PIN and password where anyone can see them, or use them when anyone else can see what you are entering.
+ Do not write down or store your sensitive account information on your computer hard drive, diskette, mobile phone, or any place where others might find them.
+ Do not use automatic password save features.
+ Do not use your TSP PIN and Web web password to access other financial (or non-financial) services.
+ If you believe someone else knows your password or PIN, change it immediately.
+ Never access your TSP account from an unprotected computer, such as public computers found in libraries, internet cafes, hotels, schools, etc.
+ Make sure the TSP has your correct address. Transaction confirmations or participant statements sent to an old address compromise your account information.
