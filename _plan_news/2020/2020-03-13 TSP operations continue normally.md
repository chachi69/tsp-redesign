**TSP operations continue normally** &#8212; As the coronavirus situation evolves worldwide, we’re working hard to make sure that TSP operations continue normally, and that we’re able to continue to serve you.

- We continue to process forms and requests.
- TSP representatives are available to answer your questions.
- You can access your account online through My Account.

This is a changing situation, and we will communicate with you as soon as possible if anything affects our operations. In the meantime, here are some tips for you to consider.

**Make sure you can access your TSP account online and by phone.** For online access, you need your account number (or user ID), your password, and access to your validated email or cell phone. If you haven't already, **add and validate a personal email or cell phone** to your TSP account so you can log in securely from your personal devices with two-step authentication. If you're having trouble logging in, read our tips and troubleshooting information. For access by calling the ThriftLine, you’ll need your account number and PIN.

**Avoid longer wait times on the ThriftLine by calling during off-peak hours.** Your wait might be longer if you call during peak hours, such as in the morning. If you need to reach a TSP representative by phone, try calling in the afternoon, Tuesday through Friday, to reduce your chances of a long wait. As an alternative, you can use the secure messaging service online after you log into My Account.
