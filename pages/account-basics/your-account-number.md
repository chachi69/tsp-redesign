# Your account number


## How to gain access to My Account

To log in to My Account, enter your 13-digit TSP account number, which was
mailed to you, or your user ID that you created and your web password.

Your password will either be the one mailed to you, a temporary password that a Participant Service Representative (PSR) provided to you, or the one
you created when you logged into your account. The first time you log into your account, you’ll be prompted to create a new password of your choice.

Once you’re in, you’ll be securely connected to all your account information. You also can access your account information via the ThriftLine by using the
4-digit Personal Identification Number (PIN), which was mailed to you.
