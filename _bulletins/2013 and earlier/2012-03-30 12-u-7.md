In support of Financial Literacy Month, April 2012, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is pleased to
announce the publication of its special poster, “Will Roth TSP fit into your future?” We hope
that you can use the poster in conjunction with other activities you may have planned for
Financial Literacy Month. The poster features puzzle pieces of traditional contributions and
Roth contributions, leading participants to question whether Roth contributions may fit into
their own financial plans. Now is a great time for participants to begin considering whether
to include the new Roth TSP option as they re-evaluate their financial targets and update
their long-term retirement goals.
