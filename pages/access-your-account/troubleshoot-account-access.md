You can resolve most common account access problems by [requesting your account information]({{ site.baseurl }}/access-your-account/request-your-tsp-account-information/), updating your [validated contact information]({{ site.baseurl }}/access-your-account/validate-your-contact-information/), or changing the way you receive [your one-time security codes]({{ site.baseurl }}/access-your-account/receive-one-time-security-codes/) for login.

If you encounter a different issue and can’t find the information you need here, you can [call the ThriftLine]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) and speak to a TSP representative for help.

## Financial aggregators, apps, or services on other websites
If you give your account credentials to a third-party application, you may receive a verification code each time that application attempts to retrieve information from your TSP account. Providing your TSP account credentials to a third-party application [may put your account security at risk]({{ site.baseurl }}/access-your-account/protect-your-tsp-account/).

We recommend that you only log in to My Account through [secure.tsp.gov]({{ site.myaccount }}). The TSP cannot endorse any information or advice from third-party applications or services.

## Internet browser compatibility
An older internet browser may not support the security features you need to view personal account information.

## Dual civilian and uniformed services accounts
If you have both a civilian and a uniformed services TSP account, you can connect them by setting the same password for both accounts. Connecting your accounts in this way allows you to toggle between them without having to log out and log back in.

Your account number and user ID are the same for your civilian and uniformed services accounts.

## IP address errors while using My Account
For security reasons, the Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to your computer or device must remain the same during your My Account session. You might see a browser-to-server authentication error and get disconnected from your My Account session **if you’re accessing your account from a mobile device** that changes data networks in the background. In this case, you need to log in again and start a new session.

Some network managers use security protocols to change IP addresses randomly for different online transactions, which can also generate a browser-to-server authentication error. If you’re accessing your account from a workstation connected to this type of network, your My Account session may end suddenly, and you may receive a message that your IP address changed. To assist participants that use **workstations connected to a .gov or .mil network** with multiple security protocols, the Network Security Administrator for that Agency or Service should email the [TSP Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@tsp.gov?subject=TSP.gov%20IP%20Exception%20Request) for an &#8220;IP Address Exception.&#8221;
