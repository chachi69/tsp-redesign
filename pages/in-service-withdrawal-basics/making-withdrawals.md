# Making an in-service withdrawal

## Applying for a financial hardship withdrawal

To apply for a financial hardship withdrawal, log in to [My Account](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html) and use the wizard to complete Form TSP-76, *Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawal Request.* You can complete your request online unless you are required to obtain your spouse's signed consent or you want to receive your money by check or direct deposit to your bank account. 
 
If you have a pending application for another in-service withdrawal or for a TSP loan at the time your financial hardship withdrawal request is received, your request will not be accepted. We allow only one request for an in-service withdrawal or a loan at a time.
 
## Applying for an age-based withdrawal

To apply for an age-based withdrawal, log in to [My Account](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html) and use the wizard to complete Form TSP-75, *Age-Based In-Service Withdrawal Request.* You can complete your request online unless you are required to obtain your spouse's signed consent waiver or you want to receive your money by check or by direct deposit to your bank account.
 
If you have a pending application for another in-service withdrawal or for a TSP loan at the time your age-based withdrawal request is received, your request will not be accepted. We allow only one request for an in-service withdrawal or a loan at a time.

## Receiving your in-service withdrawal

Your in-service withdrawal check will be mailed to the address in your TSP account record. However, if you are making a paper withdrawal request, you may request to have your withdrawal payment electronically deposited into your checking or savings account. If you are transferring any portion of your age-based withdrawal, we will mail the check to your IRA or eligible employer plan.
 
If you complete your request online, you will not have the option of receiving an electronic deposit of your funds or transferring any part of your withdrawal to an eligible employer plan.
 
It will take several weeks from the time we receive your properly completed form until the time we send your check.
 
To find out the status of your in-service withdrawal, visit [My Account](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html) or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778. We will also notify you in writing when your request has been processed.
