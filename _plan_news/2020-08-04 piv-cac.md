**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; We will temporarily accept certain digital signatures on TSP forms in order to support participants in physical distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. To be eligible, you must use your unexpired U.S. federal personal identity verification (PIV) credentials or common access card (CAC) to sign your form before you submit it to us.
