**Government Reopening: Missed TSP contributions and loan payments** - When you submit back pay, please ensure that all employee contributions, agency contributions, and loan payments are made for the period of pay missed during the shutdown. You should submit contributions on late payment records. Make sure the “as of” date for all contributions and loan payments is the date the payment should have been made. **If your payroll system does not deduct loan payments from back pay, you will need to inform your employees to submit their loan payments directly to the TSP using the [Loan Payment Coupon](/forms/tsp-26/)**. Note, if you need to make corrections to the payroll file later, please be aware that if the corrected payroll record is more than 30 days from the “as of date,” breakage will automatically be calculated. Payroll offices can contact Agency Technical Services (ATS) for clarification or with questions.
