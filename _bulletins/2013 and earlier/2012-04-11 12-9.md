The Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act of 2009, Public Law 111-31, signed into law on June 22, 2009, authorized the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to add a Roth feature to the plan. This benefit allows participants to contribute on an after-tax basis to their TSP accounts and receive tax-free earnings when they withdraw the funds (assuming certain criteria are met).
