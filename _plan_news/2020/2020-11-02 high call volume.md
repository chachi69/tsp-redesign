**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; We are currently experiencing high call volume and longer-than-normal wait times for speaking to a TSP representative on the <span data-term="ThriftLine" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">ThriftLine</span>.

If you have questions about [the recent security changes in My Account]({{ site.baseurl }}/plan-news/login-changing-2020-10-06/), such as needing a user ID to log in, please use the new online tools to create or recover your <span data-term="User ID" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">user ID</span> online. For security purposes, TSP representatives on the ThriftLine do not have access to this information.

**How to create or recover your My Account user ID online**
- If you don't have a user ID, you must [create a user ID]({{ site.userid_create }}). Youâ€™ll first need to log in with your <span data-term="Account Number" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">TSP account number</span> and <span data-term="Password" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">password</span>.
- If you've forgotten your user ID, you can [recover your user ID]({{ site.userid_forgot }}).

**Our highest call volume is on Monday and Tuesday mornings.** If you want to minimize your wait time to speak to a TSP representative, consider [calling the ThriftLine]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) outside of those peak hours.
