**Help for Hurricane Maria victims Updated – Extended Deadline** &#8212; The TSP has made a temporary change to the financial hardship withdrawal rules for participants affected by Hurricane Maria: As of October 4, 2017, we will treat any Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawal Request as a qualifying hardship and will waive the rule prohibiting employee contributions for 6 months after taking a hardship withdrawal provided one of the following is true:

1. Your primary residence or place of employment is located in a [covered disaster area]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=68)  and has incurred a loss as a result of Hurricane Maria.<br>
**OR**
2. Your hardship withdrawal will be used to assist an eligible family member who lives or works in a [covered disaster area]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=68)  and who has incurred a loss as a result of Hurricane Maria.

**IN ADDITION**, you must also meet **all** of the following requirements:

- You must be actively employed as a federal civilian or a member of the uniformed services.
- You must complete [Form TSP-76]({{ site.withdrawals }}), _Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawal Request_.
- You must write “Hurricane Maria” at the top of page 1 above the name of the form.
- You must check the “Personal Casualty Loss” box on page 2, Item 18 of your request form, as the reason for requesting financial hardship.
- Your request must be **received in our office** by March 8, 2018 **and**, in compliance with IRS guidelines, your distribution must occur before March 15, 2018. Any Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawal Request forms received after March 8, 2018 will be processed as a standard hardship withdrawal, and your TSP contributions will automatically stop for 6 months.

**If you want to stop your TSP contributions**, complete [Form TSP-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-1.pdf), _Election Form_ ([Form TSP-U-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-u-1.pdf) for uniformed services) or use your agency or service’s automated system.

This rule change is not retroactive and all other Form TSP-76 rules apply. Participants may only receive one hardship withdrawal under this change. If you have questions about this change, call the toll-free ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778. Outside the U.S. and Canada, please call 404-233-4400 (not toll free).
