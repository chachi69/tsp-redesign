# Awareness and Training

Handling and safeguarding PII maintained and used by FRTIB personnel is necessary to ensure the trust of TSP participants and beneficiaries. Privacy Act requests involving participants who request TSP account-specific information are administered by a division within FRTIB’s Office of Participant Services. In an effort to protect PII, FRTIB’s Information Security Management Division has deployed a data loss prevention (DLP) tool to enhance the security of FRTIB’s most critical asset—PII. FRTIB’s DLP enhances privacy protections to PII and helps to reduce breaches.

## New Employee Orientation Training

Attorneys from FRTIB’s Privacy Division provide in-person privacy training to all new employees on their first day of beginning work with the Agency. New employee orientation sessions provide an overview about the importance of privacy at FRTIB, how to handle privacy-protected information, and the penalties for violating the Privacy Act. This presentation also includes an overview of the importance of completing PTAs and PIAs for all FRTIB systems. Finally, the Privacy Division ensures all new employees are briefed on the importance of immediately reporting all potential and actual incidents involving PII to the IRT.

## Enterprise Learning Management Training (ELMS)

FRTIB delivers privacy-specific courses, including annual training, through the Agency’s centralized training system, called ELMS. Employees and contractors have the ability to access content contained in the system.  

## Role-Based Training

In addition to new-hire and annual privacy training requirements, FRTIB’s Privacy Division provides role-based training to employees with specialized roles on a periodic basis, focusing on how employees in various FRTIB Offices should leverage the FIPPs as part of their official duties.
