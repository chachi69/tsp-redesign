We have developed and posted on the TSP Web site 6/2008 versions of Forms TSP-9, Change in Address for Separated Participant, and TSP-15, Change in Name for Separated Participant. Both forms are designed to be read by an optical scanner. We are also reinstating the documentation requirements for Form TSP-15. These forms are intended for use only by separated participants. Please discard all obsolete versions. (Please see Bulletins 09-5 and 09-6.)
