The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board has issued interim regulations that allow the Executive Director to adopt a policy of setting limits on the number of interfund transfers requests. In the near term, this interim regulation allows the Executive Director to immediately address and, if necessary, restrict the activity of frequent traders, who have disrupted management of the TSP Funds and whose activity has resulted in increased costs to all participants. This interim rule is effective January 7, 2008. For more information about frequent trading, see the Questions and Answers on the TSP Web site Home page.
