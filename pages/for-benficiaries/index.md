# For beneficiaries

## Notifying the TSP of a participantâ€™s death

If you are the next-of-kin or legal representative of a deceased TSP participant, you should notify us __immediately__ in the event of their death. You can do this in one of two ways:

+ If the participant was an active federal employee or member of the uniformed services, report the death to the participant's employing agency or service.
+ Otherwise, report the participant's death to us by calling 1-877-968-3778. Press 3 from the main menu and hold to speak to a Participant Service Representative.

## In this section:

+ Being a beneficiary participant 
+ Designating beneficiaries
+ Beneficiary distributions
