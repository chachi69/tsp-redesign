In support of Financial Literacy Month, April 2013, the TSP is pleased to announce the publication of a special poster, “Now is the right time to save.” A recent study quoted in the Journal of Financial Planning found that only 16% of Americans included financial planning in their New Year’s resolutions for 2013, down from 20% in 2012 and 33% in 2009. This trend is surprising at a time when responsibility for retirement security continues to shift from employers to individuals. We hope that our poster, in conjunction with your other financial literacy initiatives, will inspire employees to assess their retirement readiness and
reinvigorate their efforts to save for a secure future.
