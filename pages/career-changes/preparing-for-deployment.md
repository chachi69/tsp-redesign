# Preparing for deployment or TDY

You have a lot to think about as you prepare to go on deployment or TDY. You can minimize problems that may arise regarding your TSP account if you take the following actions:

### Employee contributions

+ You can still contribute to your uniformed services account while deployed. It is a good idea to contribute a percentage of your basic pay, which entitles you to contribute a percentage of any incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay.
+ If you’ll receive tax-free pay, such as combat zone or hazardous duty pay, while deployed, you may consider adjusting your contributions. When you contribute that pay to Roth TSP (after-tax), the earnings from your pay will also be tax-exempt when you withdraw them. However, you will still have to meet the current IRC maximum elective deferral limits.

### TSP uniformed services account

+ Don’t have a uniformed services account yet? You may want to establish one by using your service’s electronic payroll system, for example, myPay, or by submitting Form TSP-U-1, Election Form, to your service.
+ Read TSP Benefits That Apply to Members of the Military Who Return to Federal Civilian Service to learn more.

### TSP loans

Unless you enter a nonpay status, your loan payments will continue to be deducted from your pay while you’re deployed. Ask your service representative if there are any special circumstances that may affect your loan payments.

### Remember the basics
+ Make sure we have your current mailing address. If necessary, ask your service representative to correct or change your mailing address for your TSP account.
+ Be sure you have your TSP account number (or user ID), web password, and ThriftLine PIN. If you have lost or forgotten these numbers, you may request your account number be mailed to you.
+ Acquaint yourself with TSP contribution limits.

### Give a power of attorney

Before you deploy, you can designate a power of attorney—an individual to serve as your agent in any business with the TSP. Your agent can be given very specific powers or unlimited power to act on your behalf. Use the Special Power of Attorney form to designate a power of attorney.

### Review beneficiaries

If you’d like your TSP account paid out in the statutory order of precedence in the event of your death, it is not necessary to designate beneficiaries.

If you have designated beneficiaries on file with us, review, update, or change information, if necessary. We do not accept any other types of designations (such as wills).
