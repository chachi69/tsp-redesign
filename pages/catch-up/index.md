## Changes coming to catch-up contributions

Starting in January 2021, we’re making the process easier for participants. If you’re turning 50 or older and are eligible for catch-up, you’ll no longer need to make separate catch-up elections to your TSP account each year in order to take advantage of [catch-up contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/contribution-types/), or &#8220;contributions toward the IRS catch-up limit.&#8221;

**Note: For 2020 catch-up contributions, you do still need to complete the current process and make a separate election.** Check [current contribution limits]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/contribution-limits/) to make sure you’re on track this year.

## Here’s how it will work

- Next year, if you’re turning 50 or older and exceed the IRS elective deferral (or annual addition) limit, then your contributions will automatically start counting toward the IRS catch-up limit.<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup> Just add any contributions toward the catch-up limit in the same place as your other TSP contributions.

- Your election will carry over each year unless you submit a new one. For instructions on submitting a new election, see [Start, change, or stop contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/).

- If you’re eligible for an agency or service match, contributions spilling over toward the catch-up limit will qualify for the match<sup>[2](#footnotes)</sup> on up to 5% of your salary.<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup>

- You may [start, stop, or change your contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/) at any time. If you choose not to contribute toward the catch-up limit, you should adjust your TSP contributions accordingly.

## Important note for members of the uniformed services

If you are a uniformed services member and enter a combat zone, your contributions toward the catch-up limit must be Roth. (The TSP cannot accept traditional tax-exempt contributions toward the catch-up limit.) You also cannot contribute toward the catch-up limit from incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay.

If you are contributing to both a civilian and uniformed services account, the limits apply to the total you contribute to both accounts during the year.

## Dates of upcoming webinars and trainings

We will continue to update this page as the dates of upcoming webinars and trainings are coming soon.

<div class="note usa-alert-paragraph" markdown="1">
<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note to Pam:** Consider announcing and listing webinars and trainings via [Plan news]({{ site.baseurl }}/news-and-resources/plan-news/) only, since subscribers receive email notifications.
1. If we only place the information on this non-subscriber page, how will people know when it's updated?
2. If the idea is to update this page _and then_ notify people via Plan news with a link to this page, that's a duplication of effort.
3. When the new catch-up method = the new normal, this historical information should be accessible through the [Plan news archive]({{ site.baseurl }}/news-and-resources/plan-news/#archived-news-and-announcements). Otherwise, this page will need to exist long after the updates have ceased. #stale

## Additional information and resources

We will continue to update this page as additional information and resources are coming soon.

<div class="note usa-alert-paragraph" markdown="1">
<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note to Pam:** I recommend not creating this section or the one above until you have the relevant content. Why? Imagine reading costs money.
</div>

1. For 2020, eligible participants should complete [Form TSP-1-C]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-1-c.pdf) (<span class="nobr">[TSP-U-1-C]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-u-1-c.pdf)</span> for uniformed services members) or use your payroll system’s &#8220;catch-up&#8221; option. Also, 2020 catch-up contributions aren’t matched.
2. For Blended Retirement System (BRS) participants: If you have reached the annual addition limit, your contributions toward catch-up will not be matched. (The IRS does not allow participants who have reached the annual addition limit to receive any more matching for the year.)
