The 2010 Military Saves Week begins on February 21 and continues through February 28. The focus is to encourage individuals and families to reduce debt and increase savings. Executive Director Gregory Longs's letter addresses the program and the TSP's role in supporting it. See [Bulletin 10-U-2]({{ site.baseurl }}/bulletins/10-u-2.pdf). A special poster is currently available to all federal agencies for distribution and posting.
