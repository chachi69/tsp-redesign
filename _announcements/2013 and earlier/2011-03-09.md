To answer questions about TSP participation in the event of a Federal Government shutdown, the TSP has published the fact sheet, [Impact of a Government Shutdown on the Thrift Savings Plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/bulletins/oc11-05.pdf). The fact sheet also emphasizes that agencies and services should not submit Form TSP-41 (or U-41), Notification to TSP of Nonpay Status, in the event that a government shutdown should occur. The fact sheet is available as a link from the Bulletin Board on the TSP website home page.
