**More Lifecycle Funds will be available July 1** &#8212; Starting July 1, 2020, you will have ten Lifecycle (L) Funds to choose from instead of the five currently available. We’re adding the additional L Funds so that the target dates will be separated by only five years instead of ten, allowing you to more precisely target the time when you think you’ll need your money. Six more L Funds will be added, and the L 2020 Fund, having reached its target date, will be rolled into the L Income Fund. See the fact sheet _[Additional Lifecycle (L) Funds]( {{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspfs27.pdf)_ for more information.
