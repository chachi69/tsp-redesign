Form TSP-70, Request for Full Withdrawal, has been revised, and the 6/2013 version is available for download from the TSP website. Earlier editions of the form are obsolete. Agencies that maintain an inventory of TSP forms should destroy or recycle previous editions of the form. Agencies that make forms available electronically should take down obsolete editions.

We strongly recommend that participants use the [withdrawal wizard]({{ site.withdrawals }}) available at www.tsp.gov under "My Account: Online Transactions" to complete and print their withdrawal requests. Participants who prefer completing the paper version of the form should download and print the form from the TSP website at the time they need it to ensure they are submitting a current, valid version.
