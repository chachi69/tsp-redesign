The Thrift Saving Plan (TSP) has implemented its loan default program. This program is mandated by Internal Revenue Service regulations which apply to all 401(k) plans, including
the TSP. Essentially, the regulations provide that at the end of each calendar quarter, plans like the TSP must identify loan accounts that are missing payments and notify participants
that they have until the end of the following quarter to pay the missing amount. If the payments are not made up, the loan balance is declared a taxable distribution. The amount of
the distribution is treated as income and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty tax. (See “Repaying a Loan” in the booklet TSP Loans.)
