# Tax-exempt balances for the uniformed services

If you have a uniformed services TSP account, it may include tax-exempt contributions in your traditional balance 
as a result of your having served in a combat zone. These contributions (but not the earnings on them) are exempt from
federal income taxes when they are distributed. The earnings on tax-exempt traditional contributions will be subject 
to tax at the time that you make a withdrawal.
 
If your tax-exempt contributions are applied to your Roth TSP balance, those contributions and the earnings on them 
will be exempt from federal income taxes when they are distributed.

Withdrawals from a uniformed services account will be made pro rata (i.e., proportionally) from taxable and nontaxable amounts.
Be sure to read the tax notice [Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account](#) for more information.
