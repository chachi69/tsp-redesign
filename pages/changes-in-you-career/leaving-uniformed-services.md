# Leaving uniformed services

Did you know if your account balance is $200 or more, you can leave it in the TSP when you leave the uniformed services?

Once you leave the uniformed services, you’ll no longer be able to make contributions to your account. However, you can keep more of what you save thanks to our low costs, change your investment mix, and transfer eligible money into your account — all while your account continues to accrue earnings.

As you prepare to leave the uniformed services, here are four important things you must do:
+ Make sure we have your current address at all times. While you’re an active duty service member, you can update your address through the MyPay website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.
+ If you have any TSP loans, pay them off within 90 days of your separation.
+ Read Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service to fully understand your options before you leave the uniformed services.
+ Read the tax notice Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account.
+ Read the fact sheet TSP Benefits That Apply to Members of the Military Who Return to Federal Civilian Service to fully understand all of your rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
