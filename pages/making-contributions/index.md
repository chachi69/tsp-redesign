# Making contributions

If you’re a FERS or CSRS employee or a BRS member who began or rejoined federal service after October 1, 2020, your agency or service automatically enrolled you in the TSP, and 5% of your basic salary is deducted from your paycheck every pay period and deposited into the traditional balance of your TSP account<sup>1</sup> unless you made a contribution election to stop or change your contributions. If you’re a BRS member who stopped your contributions during the year, you are automatically re-enrolled at 5% of your basic pay on <span class="nobr">January 1</span>.

If you’re a FERS or CSRS employee or a BRS member who began or rejoined federal service between August 1, 2010, and September 30, 2020, you were automatically enrolled at 3%.

1. BRS members who began service on or after January 1, 2018, are not automatically enrolled until they have served for 60 days.
