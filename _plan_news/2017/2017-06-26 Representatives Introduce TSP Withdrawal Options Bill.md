**Representatives Introduce TSP Withdrawal Options Bill** &#8212; On June 23, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Mark Meadows introduced a bill, H.R. 3031, to provide more flexibility on TSP participants’ withdrawal options. The bill would eliminate the restriction that participants cannot take partial post-separation withdrawals if they’ve already taken an age-based in-service withdrawal. It would also permit multiple post-separation withdrawals. Additionally, the bill would allow multiple age-based withdrawals while a participant is still working. Participants would also be able to stop monthly payments and elect to purchase an annuity while receiving monthly payments.
