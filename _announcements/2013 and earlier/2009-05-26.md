The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board attended this conference and conducted a presentation highlighting the current legislative initiatives, status of the TSP Web site redesign and the L Funds DVD update projects. A copy of the presentation (with additional slides providing a recap of last year's benefits activities) is available for representatives not able to attend this conference.
