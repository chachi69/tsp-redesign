## How do I change my address?

How you change your address with us depends on whether or not you still work for the federal government

If you’re currently a federal employee, you must report your correct address to your agency or service. We can’t accept address changes directly from you.

If you’re no longer a federal employee, log into the My Account section of tsp.gov, visit “<a href="javascript:void(0)">Profile Settings</a>,” and review and change the address listed there. Or while you’re logged in, you can use our online wizard to complete <a href="javascript:void(0)">Change in Address for Separated Participants</a>, Form TSP-9. You can also fax or mail it to us.

If you’re an active duty uniformed services member, you can update your address through the <a href="https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx" target="\_blank">myPay</a> website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.
