This bulletin outlines the changes to the TSP Error Report 1701, which identifies data records that were not processed and records that were processed but appear suspect. Public Law 112-96, Section 5001, the “Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012,” made two significant amendments to the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS).
