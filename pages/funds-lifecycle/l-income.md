# L Income

The L Income Fundâ€™s investment objective is to achieve a low level of growth with a high emphasis on preservation of assets. Unlike the other four L Funds, the L Income Fund's asset allocation does not change quarterly. However, like the other funds, it is rebalanced daily to maintain its target investment mix.

You should consider investing in the L Income Fund if you are currently withdrawing money from your TSP account in monthly payments or you plan to begin withdrawing money before 2019.
