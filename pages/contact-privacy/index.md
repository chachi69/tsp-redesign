# How to contact us

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires that each Government agency designate a Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) who has agency-wide responsibility and accountability for the agency’s privacy program. General Counsel Megan Grumbine serves as FRTIB’s SAOP.

If you would like to contact FRTIB’s Privacy Office, or if you would like to submit a privacy complaint, please email us at [privacy@tsp.gov](mailto:privacy@tsp.gov).

Additionally, we have developed instructions for submitting a [Privacy Act request]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact-privacy/submit-privacy-act-request/) if you wish to access or correct records that FRTIB maintains about you.
