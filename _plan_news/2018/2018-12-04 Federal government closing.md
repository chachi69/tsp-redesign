**Federal government closing** &#8212; Some financial markets and the federal government will be **closed on Wednesday, December 5**, in observance of the national day of mourning for the late President George H.W. Bush. Therefore, the Thrift Savings Plan will not be updating share prices in any of the TSP funds for that day. Transactions that would have been processed Wednesday night (December 5) will be processed Thursday night (December 6) at Thursdayâ€™s closing share prices. If you have questions about your TSP account, the ThriftLine (1-877-968-3778) will remain open on Wednesday, December 5.
