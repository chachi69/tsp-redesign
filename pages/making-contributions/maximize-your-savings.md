# Maximize your savings

When it comes to reaching your retirement goals, it’s important that you
maximize your savings. You can start by making sure you’re not leaving free
money on the table. Are you contributing enough to get at least the full match from your agency or service?

## Am I eligible for matching?
Only employees covered by the <span data-term="Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS)" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">Federal Employees Retirement System</span> (for civilians) and the <span data-term="Blended Retirement System (BRS)" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">Blended Retirement System </span> (for uniformed services) are eligible for matching. If you are brand new to federal or uniformed service, you are covered by one of these systems.
