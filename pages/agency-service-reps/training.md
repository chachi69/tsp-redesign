#### TSP webinar privacy notice

Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) hosted TSP webinars require participants to complete a registration form via WebEx.

The Federal Employees Retirement System Act (FERSA), codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. Ch. 84, authorizes us to request the information contained on this registration form. Registration is required to participate in the webinar, but your participation in the webinar is voluntary. By submitting this form, you acknowledge that we may record the webinar, including questions and comments from webinar participants. We will use the information you provide to communicate with you and to improve TSP training materials. You may refrain from voicing a question or comment if you do not wish to be recorded.

We will collect and maintain registration information and webinar recordings as part of FRTIB’s System of Records FRTIB-20 – Communications, Education, and Outreach Materials. The System of Records Notice (SORN) for this system, which describes the system in more depth, is available at tsp.gov/privacy. We will not share your information with any third parties without your consent unless required by law.

**We strongly encourage you to heed the advice of your federal, state, and local guidelines and practice social distancing and routinely wash your hands.**

**Thank you for your understanding in these uncertain times.**
