# How to create a user ID on tsp.gov

You must create a user ID to log in securely to My Account and manage your Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account online. If you previously created a user ID and can’t remember it, you may be able to follow prompts to recover your user ID online.

**Note**: You need your **TSP account number** and **web password** to create your user ID.

**You now have access to your account.** From now on, you’ll use your user ID and web password to log in to My Account on secure.tsp.gov. If you forget your user ID, you can recover it online by selecting the link, [**Recover user ID**](#recover-user-id) on the My Account login page.

**If you have both a civilian and uniformed services account,** your new user ID will apply to both accounts.
