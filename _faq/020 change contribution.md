In most cases, you’ll use your agency’s or service’s electronic payroll system to start, change, or stop your TSP contributions. For example, civilian payroll systems include [Employee Express](/exit/?idx=7){:rel="nofollow"}, EBIS, [LiteBlue](/exit/?idx=8){:rel="nofollow"}, [myPay](/exit/?idx=6){:rel="nofollow"}, or [NFC EPP](/exit/?idx=9){:rel="nofollow"}. Uniformed services can use [myPay](/exit/?idx=6){:rel="nofollow"} (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps) or [Direct Access](/exit/?idx=47){:rel="nofollow"} (Coast Guard and NOAA Corps).

If your agency or service accepts the paper form, download and complete the Form TSP-1, [_Election Form_](/forms/tsp-1.pdf) (or [Form TSP-U-1](/forms/tsp-u-1.pdf) for uniformed services members), or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to have it mailed to you.
