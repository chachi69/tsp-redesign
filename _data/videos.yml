  video_transcript: "Your TSP Investment Options: The Lifecycle Funds

  The TSP has a selection of individual and lifecycle funds that let you diversify your retirement savings. You can choose to invest your TSP dollars in everything from short-term U.S. Treasury securities to index funds comprised of domestic and international stocks. In this video, we’ll talk about the professionally designed Lifecycle Funds, also known as the L Funds. If you don’t have the time, experience, or interest to manage your TSP retirement savings, consider one of the L Funds.

  Each L Fund features a combination of the five individual funds (G, F, C, S, and I) that is appropriate for your “time horizon” or the future date at which you plan to start withdrawing the money in your TSP account.

  Here’s how it works:

  The L Funds assume that the farther you are away from needing your money, the more you are able to tolerate risk. Therefore, they give you the opportunity to enjoy the potentially higher returns associated with investing in the stock markets. But the funds continually adjust, so as the time nears for you to withdraw your money, it is more conservatively invested. That way, you’re not exposing your entire savings to unexpected market changes right when you need the income.

  As with all investments, there are risks. The L Funds carry the same risks that are associated with all of the underlying individual TSP funds. Watch our other fund videos for more information.

  To find out which L Fund might be right for you, or to learn about the other TSP funds, watch our entire series of fund videos. Or visit tsp.gov to review our fund information sheets."

  video_transcript: "Your TSP Investment Options: The G Fund

  The TSP has a selection of individual and lifecycle funds that let you diversify your retirement savings.  You can choose to invest your TSP dollars in everything from short-term U.S. Treasury securities to index funds comprised of domestic and international stocks.

  In this video, we'll talk about the Government Securities Investment Fund, also known as the G Fund.

  When you put your money in the G Fund, where does it really go?  It's invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities specially issued to the TSP. It allows you to earn interest rates similar to long-term government securities with no risk of principal loss, because the payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the Federal Government.

  Here are a few more things you need to know

  The G Fund is the default investment fund for all participants who are newly enrolled (or automatically enrolled) in the TSP.  This means that unless you make a request to have your contributions invested in the other options, or distribute money that’s in your account right now to the other funds, all of your TSP savings will remain invested in the G Fund.

  There’s a great benefit to having the G Fund as an investment: You'll never lose money as long as you're in it.

  But there can be a downside to having all of your money in the G Fund if you won't need your retirement savings for a while:  You won't have an opportunity to enjoy the potentially higher long-term returns of the bond and stock markets.

  Want to know more about the G Fund or any of the other TSP investment options?  Watch our entire series of fund videos. Or visit tsp.gov to review our fund information sheets."

  The TSP has a selection of individual and lifecycle funds that let you diversify your retirement savings.  You can choose to invest your TSP dollars in everything from short-term U.S. Treasury securities to index funds comprised of domestic and international stocks.

  In this video, we'll talk about the Fixed Income Index Investment Fund, also known as the F Fund.

  When you put your money in the F Fund, what are you getting? The F Fund is invested in an index fund that tracks the performance of the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. This index is comprised of Treasury and Agency bonds, asset-backed securities, and corporate and non-corporate bonds.

  Here are a few more things you need to know:

  There are risks:
  The F Fund moves up and down with returns in the bond market.
  Also, there's a chance that principal and interest on bonds that comprise the index will not be paid , or that principal will be paid early if interest rates fall.
  Finally, there's a chance that your F Fund investment may not grow enough to offset inflation, which chips away at your buying power.

  But with risk comes reward.  In the F Fund, you have the opportunity to earn potentially higher rates of return, over the long term, than you would by only investing in the G Fund.

  It’s crucial that you keep your mailing address up to date so that you receive important information about your TSP account that might not be available online. How you change your address with us depends on whether you still work for the federal government.

  If you’re currently a federal employee, you must report your correct address to your agency. Since your agency is responsible for maintaining information about you and submitting it to us if you’re still employed, we can’t accept address changes directly from you.

  If you’re no longer a federal employee, you can log into the My Account section of tsp.gov, visit “Profile Settings,” and review the address listed there. If you need to update it, simply make any necessary changes while you’re logged in to My Account. Or you can fill out Form TSP-9, Change in Address for Separated Participants, and fax or mail it to us.

  If you’re an active duty uniformed services member, you can update your address through the myPay website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.

  Starting in the year you turn 50, you can make catch-up contributions to your TSP account that exceed the Internal Revenue Code’s annual elective deferral limit.

  To be eligible to make catch-up contributions, you must expect to contribute the maximum amount allowed of regular employee contributions for the year to the TSP, or to an equivalent tax-deferred employer plan.

  To start, stop, or change your catch-up contribution election to your TSP account, use Form TSP-1-C, Catch-Up Contribution Election (or Form TSP-U-1-C for uniformed services). Your catch-up contributions will stop automatically when you reach the catch-up contribution limit, or at the end of the calendar year—whichever comes first. You must make a new catch-up contribution election each calendar year by completing and submitting a new form. You can download the form from tsp.gov or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to request a copy.

  video_transcript: "Hi, I’m Lazetta from the TSP.  We know life happens, and you might be tempted to take a loan from your TSP account. If you do, be aware that taking a TSP loan might cost a lot more than you think.

  When you take out a loan from your TSP account there are some obvious costs to consider:

  - There’s a loan fee of $50 for administrative expenses deducted from the loan check,
  - you temporarily deplete your balance, and
  - you must repay your loan with interest.

  Some costs are a little less clear:

  - All loan repayments are ‘after-tax,’ which means you’ll lose the tax benefit on whatever portion of your loan consisted of Roth money, so you’ll be taxed twice AND will have to pay tax twice on the portion of your payment that represents interest, and
  - because your account balance is depleted, you’ll lose the compound interest you would have earned on that amount had you not taken out the loan.

  Remember: the purpose of contributing to the TSP is to provide you with retirement income, not to build up a balance to borrow from. So, think twice before you take a TSP loan. Your TSP account and your future self will thank you!

  video_transcript: "Hi, I’m Chris from the TSP. We get a lot of questions about Roth versus traditional contributions. Choosing between traditional and Roth contributions can be confusing.

  First, think about if it would benefit you more to pay taxes NOW or while you’re in retirement.

  As your income goes up, your tax bracket goes up, which means you’ll end up paying a higher percentage of your income in taxes.

  If you think you’ll pay a lower percentage of your income in taxes during your retirement years than you’re currently paying, you might choose to make traditional/pre-tax contributions.

  On the other hand, if you think you’ll pay a higher percentage of your income in taxes during your retirement years than you’re paying at your current salary, you might choose to make after-tax (Roth) contributions, since the earnings have the potential to be withdrawn tax-free as long as you meet certain IRS requirements.

  The bottom line is, it’s a tax decision based on your current tax rate relative to what you expect your tax rate to be when you retire. For more information, check out our videos, “Is Roth TSP Right For Me?” – Civilian and uniformed services – at youtube.com/tsp4gov.

  video_transcript: "The TSP has taken a big step with a Roth option. Find out if Roth TSP is right for you.

  We all want to succeed financially, maximize our savings, watch our money grow, and enjoy the payoffs of wise financial planning.

  To make the right decisions you have to understand where you are now and where you want to be down the road; you need a strategy.

  The fact that you're watching this video is a great start. You probably already have a Thrift Savings Plan account or know about the plan and have heard that the TSP now offers a Roth option.

  Roth TSP is a tax strategy for your retirement savings that may pay off for you down the road.

  It's different from Traditional TSP, which takes out your contribution BEFORE taxes; your Roth TSP contribution is taken out of your pay AFTER taxes. With Roth, you contribute after-tax money at your current tax rate; then you'll never pay taxes on those contributions again.

  When you withdraw the money at retirement, your contributions and even your earnings are tax free if you're 59 and 1/2 and your first Roth contribution was at least 5 years ago. You may pay  higher taxes now, but making Roth contributions may help you  save  on taxes later.

  The key question to ask yourself is, do you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket when you need your TSP account?

  You may be in the early stages of your career and expect to earn more as the years go by, you may choose to work after you start to withdraw your TSP account, or you may think tax rates will go up.

  Any of these may mean Roth is right for you.

  Having a TSP strategy that is tailored to you will give you the comfort of knowing that you're doing the right thing for your future.

  Find out if Roth TSP is right for you by taking it one step at a time.

  First, understand your current situation. Do you know your current tax rate? Are you better off choosing TSP contributions to pay taxes now, or in the future?

  Remember, no one has a crystal ball to predict the future.  You should discuss this decision with a financial planner or tax advisor.

  Second, look really closely at the Traditional and Roth options. To help you with these options, we've put together a lot of information and it's all here on the website.

  We've also developed a Contribution Decision Wizard that lets you see the potential impact your decision will have now and later, when selecting Roth TSP or selecting Traditional TSP.

  Third, develop your own plan. This plan might just revolve around your TSP strategy, which may be Roth or Traditional, or a combination of both. Or, it might include other retirement funds, tax strategies, and assets, depending on your own financial situation.

  Just remember, you can't convert your Traditional TSP account balance to Roth TSP and you also can't transfer Roth IRAs to Roth TSP.

  Finally, get started! Once you've reviewed your current situation, your TSP options, and your retirement goals, decide if Roth is right for you.

  Or, if you've already decided that Roth TSP is right for you, use your Agency's Electronic System or download and complete Form TSP-1.

  As with all financial planning, you should re-evaluate your decisions periodically. So, even if Roth TSP may not be your best strategy now, be sure to check in whenever your life situation changes."

  video_transcript: "The TSP has taken a big step with a Roth option. Find out if Roth TSP is right for you.

  We all want to succeed financially, maximize our savings, watch our money grow, and enjoy the payoffs of wise financial planning.

  To make the right decisions you have to understand where you are now and where you want to be down the road; you need a strategy.

  The fact that you're watching this video is a great start. You may already have a Thrift Savings Plan account or know about the plan and have heard that the TSP now offers a Roth option.

  Roth TSP is a tax strategy for your retirement savings that may pay off for you down the road, especially if you're earning tax-exempt pay.  That's because both your contributions and the associated earnings will be tax-free at withdrawal, if you meet the IRS requirements.

  Roth TSP is different from Traditional TSP, where your contribution is taken out of your pay BEFORE taxes; your Roth TSP contribution is taken out AFTER taxes. With Roth, you contribute after-tax money at your current tax rate; then you'll never pay taxes on those contributions again. If you're receiving tax-exempt pay, you'll be able to further maximize your tax savings by making up to $17,000 in Roth contributions.

  When you withdraw the money at retirement, your contributions and even your earnings are tax-free if you're 59 and 1/2 and your first Roth contribution was at least 5 years ago.  With Roth, you pay taxes on your taxable income now but you may save on taxes later.

  The key question to ask yourself is, do you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket when you need your TSP account?

  For example: you may be in the early stages of your career and expect to earn more as you receive promotions over the years, you may choose to work after you start to withdraw your TSP account, or you may think tax rates will go up.

  Any of these may mean Roth is right for you.

  Having a TSP strategy that is tailored to your situation will give you the comfort of knowing that you're doing the right thing for your future.

  Find out if Roth TSP is right for you by taking it one step at a time.

  video_transcript: "As a TSP participant, you have the opportunity to invest in bonds. But what is a bond? In this video, we'll go over some of the basics.

  A bond is an investment where you lend money to an organization with the understanding that you'll get paid back, with interest, after a certain period of time.

  Most bonds offer a fixed interest rate that never changes. This is why bonds are often referred to as 'fixed income' investments. And most bonds pay you that interest every six months.

  Also, every bond has a maturity date. This means that if you hold onto your bond until that date, you should get back its value with interest.
  Bonds are generally considered less risky than investing in stocks. Because a bond has a stated value and a maturity date, you know that unless an organization goes bankrupt, you'll get back the money you invested.

  There are a couple of ways that you can invest in bonds through the TSP.
  First, you can invest directly in the TSP's Fixed Income Index Investment Fund, or F Fund. The F Fund moves up and down with returns in the bond market.
  Or you can invest in any of the TSP's Lifecycle funds, or L funds, because the F Fund is part of every L Fund.

  But you should know that bonds do have risks.

  Although bonds are fixed income investments, a fixed interest rate doesn't guarantee a fixed price. This means that when interest rates rise, the price of the bonds in the F Fund or L funds will fall, which would lower the value of your TSP account.

  And, as we mentioned before, if the company goes bankrupt, it may only return some of the money you originally lent to it. The F Fund minimizes this risk by diversifying; buying many different bonds and buying only highly rated bonds.

  Want to know more about bonds, the F Fund, or any of the other TSP investment options? Watch our series of videos on YouTube. Or visit tsp.gov to review our fund information sheets."

  video_transcript: "Have you ever spent time filling out a form and sending it in – only to find out that it couldn’t be processed?  We know how frustrating that can be. In this video, we share five tips for completing your TSP requests correctly the first time.

  One. Use our wizards. The TSP has developed interactive tools – called “wizards” – that you can use online to help complete certain requests.
  Just visit tsp.gov, sign into My Account, and look under “Online Transactions” in the left column.
  The wizard will walk you through entering your information, and our question icons can explain each step as you go.
  If you’re taking a loan or withdrawal, you can even submit your request online in some cases. Even if you aren’t eligible to complete your request online, the interactive screens prefill the appropriate sections of the form correctly. Then, all you have to do is print it out, enter any missing information – such as signatures, dates, or notary information – and mail or fax it to us.

  Two. Think inside the box. Pay special attention to any boxes you check on your form. They should match up with information you provide in other areas. For example, if you check the box on a withdrawal request indicating that you would like to transfer part of your withdrawal, make sure you complete the corresponding section with details about where the transfer should go.

  Three. Check your status. If you’ve recently left the Federal government, remember that you can keep your money in the TSP. But if you decide to make a withdrawal, make sure your agency or service notifies the TSP of your separation. We’ll send you a letter once this occurs. Until then, you are unable to receive a full or partial withdrawal while your agency or service lists you as active.

  Four. Sweat the small stuff. Many of our forms are read by an optical scanner, so even minor stray marks can cause errors. Use simple block text and be mindful of the boxes. Only complete the pages that are relevant to your account – for example, you can ignore the Roth section of a withdrawal form if you don’t have a Roth balance. And make sure that any percentages add up to 100 when they need to. Double-checking these details can save a lot of time down the line.
  Of course, if you complete your request online using a wizard, the wizard will verify your information, prevent you from making these types of mistakes and – based on the information you provide – direct you to complete only the sections you need.

  Five. Once is enough. Finally, please only send your request once. We can only process the first one we receive – even if you mail or fax the same request multiple times. For certain transactions including loans and withdrawals, you can sign into My Account and check the status of your submission within five days.

  As always, we’re a phone call away if you need help. Call 1-TSP-YOU-FRST and choose option 3 to connect with a Participant Service Representative. We’re available to speak with you weekdays from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. Eastern time."

  video_transcript: "Are you thinking about taking a TSP loan?   If so, then you should know it might cost you more than you think.

  But first, let’s review how a TSP loan works.  When you take one, you are borrowing from your own contributions and the earnings on those contributions.  You are not able to borrow from any agency or service contributions or their earnings.

  Once approved, your loan amount is removed from your TSP account.  Your repayments, which are deducted from your pay, return the money plus interest to your account.  The interest rate that you pay is the same as the G Fund rate at the time your loan application is processed.

  Now for the costs.

  When you borrow from your TSP account, you miss out on the earnings that you otherwise might have enjoyed had you not taken out the money in the first place.  And while it’s true that you’ll be paying yourself back with interest, that interest will come from your hard-earned pay rather than from investment performance.

  And if that interest turns out to be less than what your money could have earned had it stayed in your account, you’ll have less money saved even after you’ve repaid your loan.   Think about it:  This could cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in retirement income—especially if your repayments stretch over a long time period.

  Also, you’ll have to pay a loan fee.  It’s $50 and it’s deducted from your loan proceeds.  So if you request a $2,000 loan, the amount you’ll get is $1,950.

  Finally, if you fail to repay your loan in accordance with your Loan Agreement or you do not repay it when you separate from service, the TSP must report your unpaid amount to the IRS as a taxable distribution.  This means that your loan will be closed and you will owe income taxes on the taxable amount of the remaining loan balance.  If you are younger than 59½, this could be even more costly because you also may be subject to an early withdrawal penalty tax.

  You can find out more about loans on our website and you can use our loan calculator in the Planning & Tools section to estimate loan payments.  Just make sure that before you take a loan, you know what you’re getting into and what it’s costing you."

  video_transcript: "New to the TSP? Here’s What You Need to Know

  Welcome to the Thrift Savings Plan, the largest 401(k)–type plan in the world. Here are a few things you should know about it.
  As a brand new civilian employee, you’re automatically enrolled in the TSP, and 3% of your basic pay is contributed to your TSP account each pay period.

  These contributions are invested in an age-appropriate Lifecycle fund. Our Lifecycle, or L Funds, provide a mix of everything from short-term U.S. securities to index funds that are made up of domestic and international stocks. The L Funds are invested based on the future date at which you expect to start withdrawing your money, and similar funds are common in most 401(k) plans.

  But you need more than a strategic investment mix to get you to a comfortable retirement. You also have to contribute enough money to your TSP.
  On top of your salary, your agency will also contribute up to 5% of your pay to your TSP account with each paycheck. But you only get the full amount if you contribute at least 5% every pay period as well.

  You can log into your electronic payroll system  at any time to increase your contributions. We encourage you to log on and increase your contribution from the 3% default to 5% to take advantage of the full match. Don’t leave free money on the table.

  While you’re there, consider what type of contributions to make.

  You’re automatically making traditional contributions, which allow you to defer paying taxes until you withdraw your money.
  You may consider Roth contributions, which let you pay taxes on your contributions as you’re making them and receive your earnings tax-free at withdrawal, as long as you meet certain IRS conditions.

  You can also transfer other eligible retirement plans into the TSP. This is something to consider, since the TSP’s low fees let you keep more of what you save, and the TSP’s investments are comprehensive and simple. Submit Form TSP-60 for traditional transfers, and form TSP-60-R for Roth transfers.

  Investing in the TSP is the smart, simple way to save for your retirement.

  As long as your balance is $200 or more, you can leave your account right where it is.

  Whether you’re separating to begin a new career, retiring from military service, or starting a new adventure, your money can stay with the TSP and keep growing, and you can still reap the benefits that the TSP offers.

  Keep your money with us and you’ll continue to enjoy the TSP’s low administrative costs—which are lower than the industry average—and keep more of that you save.

  But even then, you won’t have to take it all at one time; you’ll still have options like taking monthly payments.

  Until then, don’t move! Your TSP account doesn’t expire when you walk out the door. You can rest assured knowing that your TSP account is here for you and your beneficiaries.

  video_transcript: "Uniformed Services: 3 Ways to Add $100,000 to Your TSP Account

  Saving for retirement sounds daunting, but here’s some inspiration: Thousands of uniformed services members younger than 35 have $100,000 or more in their TSP accounts. Here’s how you might join them.

  1. Dial down your cell phone. When you consider data and texting, most plans cost more than $75 per month. Saving that amount could grow into more than $106,000* after 35 years. You probably can’t give up your cell phone completely, but simply scaling back your usage—like making free Internet calls to reach family overseas—can make a difference.
  2. Cut back your cable. The cost of cable is ever-increasing.  If you’re willing to part with your 200 channels, saving that extra $80 a month can mean almost $114,000* in 35 years. Many providers offer basic plans at a big discount.
  3. Think small. Even minor changes can add up over time. For example, investing the $1.50 you’d spend on a soda from the base vending machine each day could grow to $45,000.* And that fancy coffee? Saving the $3.50 you’d spend on a daily cup could brew into $105,000.* The important part is to start early and be consistent.

  Found a way to save extra money? You can sign up for the TSP or increase your contributions by logging into myPay. In the “Traditional TSP and Roth TSP” section, choose how much of your pay you’d like to save, then click “Save” at the bottom of the screen.

  To learn more, visit tsp.gov.

  * Figures assume consistent saving over 30 years and an investment return of 6% per year compounded monthly."

  video_transcript: "The 10% Early Withdrawal Penalty Tax

  Are you younger than age 59½ and planning to withdraw money from your TSP account?  Then you need to know about the IRS 10% early withdrawal penalty tax.

  This penalty applies to any taxable* portion of a TSP distribution that you do not transfer or roll over to an IRA or eligible employer plan.  So it could apply to a financial hardship withdrawal that you take while still employed with the Federal Government, to a partial or full withdrawal that you might take after you’ve separated from service, or to an unpaid loan balance that is declared a taxable distribution.

  The most important thing you should know about the early withdrawal penalty tax is that it is in addition to any regular income tax you may owe on the amount of your distribution.

  The good news?  There are some exceptions in which you would not be subject to the additional tax if you take your withdrawal before age 59½. Let’s take them one at a time:

  If you separate from Federal service during or after the year you reach age 55, and you take a distribution from your TSP account before you are 59½, you will not have to pay this 10% penalty tax on any taxable amount (even on amounts that you do not transfer or roll over).  But a word of caution:  You cannot escape the additional tax by separating from service before the year you turn 55, and then waiting until you are 55 to take a distribution.

  Here’s another exception:  If you are younger than age 59½ when you separate from Federal service, and you decide to take TSP payments spread over your life expectancy, you will not have to pay the 10% additional penalty tax on those payments . The same is true on any annuity payments you receive when you use any portion of your TSP account for a life annuity.

  Let’s review several other exceptions:

  The 10% early withdrawal penalty tax does not apply to:

  - Eligible refunds of automatic enrollment contributions,
  - Payments made as a result of your total and permanent disability, or death,
  - Distributions from beneficiary participant accounts,
  - Payments ordered by a domestic relations court, or
  - Payments you receive in a year in which you have deductible medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income.

  Are you a member of the uniformed services?  Then you should also know that any portion of a TSP distribution that is made up of tax-exempt contributions from pay you earned in a combat zone pay is not subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty tax.  Furthermore, if you are an eligible Reservist called to duty for more than 179 days, you may be exempt from having to pay the additional tax on a TSP distribution.  If you are in this category, please refer to our tax notice, Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account, for details.

  Still have questions?  The TSP is happy to help you.  You can find more information on our website or you can call the ThriftLine and ask to speak to a Participant Services Representative."

  video_transcript: "Because You Asked: How Can Compound Earnings Work for Me?

  Compound earning is a simple concept that could reap big rewards for you.

  Compounding is powerful because it allows you to make money not just on what you contribute to your TSP account every pay period, but also on the money that it earns. Compounding makes it possible for your retirement savings to increase exponentially.

  For example, if you invest $100 and, over the course of a year, earn a 5% rate of return, at the end of the first year, you’ll have $105. If you leave that money alone, and the next year you earn another 5% rate of return, you’ll have $110.25.

  So, in the second year, you earned 5% on your original $100 contribution plus another 5% on the $5 you earned during the first year. At this rate, your original investment will double in less than 15 years*.

  Compounding is most effective the more years it has to work, so it’s best to start saving as soon as you can, and to save consistently.  And you benefit whether you contribute a little or a lot to your TSP account.

  Haven’t started yet? That’s ok. It’s never too late to save because every dollar makes a difference. Just sign into your agency or service’s electronic payroll system and choose the Thrift Savings Plan option. You can also complete Form TSP-1 or TSP-U-1 and return it to your agency or service.

  To learn more, visit us at tsp.gov.

  1. First is your basic annuity. After you retire, you’ll receive a pension based on your salary and how long you worked for the Federal government.
  2. Next, like most workers, you’ll be eligible for Social Security benefits.
  3. And you have the Thrift Savings Plan, the largest 401(k)-type plan in the world.
   
  Combined, these three retirement benefits need to provide enough money for you to live your ideal retirement when you no longer get a paycheck. Generally, you can only make your basic annuity and Social Security benefits higher by working longer or earning more money. 
   
  But the TSP is different: It’s the one piece that is almost entirely up to you. Saving consistently and making smart investment choices can mean the difference between a comfortable retirement and a difficult one. Plus, the TSP includes “free” money since your agency will match up to 5% of your salary. And our Lifecycle funds provide simple investment options.         
   
  The TSP: No matter what your ideal retirement looks like, we can help you get there."
