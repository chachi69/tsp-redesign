# Retired Lifecycle (L) Funds

In this section, you can view the average annual returns history of L Funds that reached their target date and were retired. When an L Fund reaches its target date, it goes out of existence and any money in it becomes part of the [L Income Fund]({{ site.baseurl }}/funds-lifecycle/l-income/), which generally keeps the same target allocation.
