The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) has developed another new leaflet-"You wouldn't do this. Would you?"-to continue its focus on FERS participants who are not contributing their own money to their TSP accounts and not receiving Agency Matching Contributions. The target group includes all noncontributing FERS participants hired up to July 31, 2010, as well as those who have been automatically enrolled in the TSP since August 1, 2010, but who have elected to stop their automatic contributions. It encourages these participants to begin to save for their retirement early and avoid letting FREE MONEY go up in flames by not taking advantage of Agency Matching Contributions.

The TSP mailed the leaflets directly to approximately 352,000 noncontributing FERS employees in late September 2010. Along with the leaflet, the mailing included a special [letter from the Executive Director]({{ site.baseurl }}/bulletins/oc10-17.pdf) of the FRTIB, and a copy of Form [TSP-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-1.pdf) to encourage immediate action. (Both the letter and the leaflet explain that some agencies require an electronic election.) The leaflet is not available for agencies to order through the TSP forms distribution system, nor will there be a corresponding bulletin.
