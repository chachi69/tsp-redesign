The 2008 TSP Participant Survey results are in. The survey, conducted by the TSP, in conjunction with Watson Wyatt Worldwide, was sent to a random sample of Federal employees and uniformed service members who have participated in the Plan. The results informed us about their opinions, needs, understanding and satisfaction with the Thrift Savings Plan. It also gauged reaction to potential TSP enhancements that are under consideration.
