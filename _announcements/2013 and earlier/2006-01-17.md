**Annuity Program** &#8212; The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board selected Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) to continue to provide annuities to participants of the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). Read the [memorandum to TSP coordinators]({{ site.baseurl }}/bulletins/2006Apr3_annuity-letter.pdf) regarding the changes to the annuity program.

**Employee Contributions** &#8212; Beginning in 2006, there were no longer any percentage limits on employee contributions to the TSP. Employee contributions are limited only by the annual elective deferral limit. See TSP Bulletin 05-17.
