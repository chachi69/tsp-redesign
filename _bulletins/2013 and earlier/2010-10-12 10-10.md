TSP is asking agency/service payroll offices to help us ensure that correct addresses are maintained in TSP records. In preparation for the 2010 Annual Statement mailing in February 2011, the TSP will be providing agency and uniformed services payroll offices with the Returned Mail Report for Agencies and the Uniformed Services (“the report”).
