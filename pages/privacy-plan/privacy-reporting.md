# Privacy Reporting

The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement agency-wide information security programs that include plans and procedures to ensure the security of operations for information systems that support the operations of the agencies. All federal agencies are required to submit an annual report to OMB; the United States Department of Homeland Security; and to specific Committees in the United States Representatives and Senate.  

FRTIB’s SAOP completes the SAOP report, which is submitted as part of FRTIB’s annual FISMA report. In response to questions developed by DHS and OMB, FRTIB’s SAOP provides an overview of a variety of activities conducted by the Privacy Division during the reporting period.
