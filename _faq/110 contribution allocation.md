title: How do I change how my money is invested?

To change which fund(s) you invest in, there are two transactions you can make:

A *contribution allocation* tells us how you want to invest NEW money coming into your account.
An *interfund transfer (IFT)* allows you to change the way money ALREADY in your account is invested.
You are allowed two IFTs in a calendar month. After that, you can only transfer money into the G Fund.

You may request a [contribution allocation]({{ site.myaccount }}/contribAlloc.do?subaction=view&_name=cae){:.target="\_blank"} or an [IFT]({{ site.myaccount }}/fundTransfer.do?subaction=view&_name=ift){:.target="\_blank"} by visiting the Online Transactions section of My Account. You can also call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and follow the automated prompts.
