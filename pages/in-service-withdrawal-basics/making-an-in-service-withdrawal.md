# Making an in-service withdrawal

## Applying for a financial hardship withdrawal or an age-based withdrawal

+ Begin your Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawal Request by going to [My Account: Withdrawals]({{ site.myaccount }}). You can begin and, in some cases, complete your request online. It depends on whether you are required to obtain your spouse's signed consent.

+ Begin your Age-Based In-Service Withdrawal Request by going to [My Account: Withdrawals]({{ site.myaccount }}). You can begin and, in some cases, complete your request online. It depends on whether you are required to obtain your spouse's signed consent waiver.

If you have a pending application for an in-service withdrawal or for a TSP loan at the time we receive your request, it will not be accepted. We allow only one request for an in-service withdrawal or loan at a time.


## Receiving your in-service withdrawal

We disburse withdrawals each business day. You can log into [My Account]({{ site.myaccount }}) or [call the ThriftLine]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) to find out the status of your withdrawal, including whether payment has been made. We will also notify you when the funds have been disbursed. Once your payment has been disbursed, you cannot return it. (See 5 C.F.R. ยง 1650.17(b).)

At your request, we will deposit your withdrawal directly into your checking or savings account via electronic funds transfer (EFT). Otherwise, we will mail your in-service withdrawal check to the address in your TSP account record. If you are transferring your age-based withdrawal to your IRA or eligible employer plan, we'll mail the check to your IRA or plan.

You should expect that it will take up to 10 business days from the time we receive your properly completed request until the time we send your check.
