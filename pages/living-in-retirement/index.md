# Living in retirement

Statistics show that people are living longer, healthier lives. It's possible that you could spend two, maybe three, decades in retirement. The money in your TSP account plays a big role in your retirement picture. You'll need those savings to provide you with current income when you need it and continuous income to last your entire lifetime. 

## Stay with the TSP

You might be leaving, but you don’t have to take your TSP account with you. Keeping your money right where it is may make more sense than you realize.

Stay with the TSP, and you can keep more of what you save thanks to our low costs. Plus, you can change your investment mix and transfer eligible money into your account. 

Life is full of regrets; don’t let leaving the TSP become one of yours. These eye-opening videos may make you think twice about moving your money to another retirement plan.
