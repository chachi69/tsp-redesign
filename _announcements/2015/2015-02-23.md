Form TSP-75, Age-Based In-Service Withdrawal Request, and Form TSP-77, Request for Partial Withdrawal When Separated, have been revised, and the 2/2015 versions are available for download from the TSP website. Earlier editions of the forms are obsolete. Agencies that maintain an inventory of TSP forms should destroy or recycle previous editions of the form. Agencies that make forms available electronically should remove obsolete editions.

We strongly recommend that participants use the withdrawal wizards available at tsp.gov under “[My Account: Online Transactions]({{ site.withdrawals }})” to complete and print their withdrawal requests. Participants who prefer completing the paper version of the form should download and print the form from the TSP website at the time they need it to ensure they are submitting a current, valid version.
