The document explicitly notifies employees and contractors that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy while using FRTIB networks or devices and notifies employees and contractors that their activity is subject to monitoring. Users are also notified via a warning banner that their activity is monitored when logging into an FRTIB device.</p>
