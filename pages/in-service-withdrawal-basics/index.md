# In-service withdrawal basics

In-service withdrawals are withdrawals you make from your TSP account while you're still actively employed in federal service or a member of the uniformed services. An in-service withdrawal can have a __serious impact__ on your TSP account. Remember that the purpose of your account is to accumulate savings so that you'll have income during retirement.

## Things to consider:

+ Withdrawals permanently reduce your retirement savings as well as any earnings you would've earned.
+ Withdrawals may be subject to income taxes or other penalties.
+ If you take a financial hardship withdrawal, you will not be able to make contributions or receive any Agency/Service Matching Contributions to your account for 6 months. **You** will be responsible for restarting your employee contributions; they do not restart automatically.
+ If you're a married FERS participant or a member of the uniformed services, your spouse must sign a consent waiver for your in-service withdrawal.
