You can check My Account or call the ThriftLine to find out the status of your withdrawal request, including whether the payment has been made. We’ll also notify you after your payment has been disbursed.  It generally takes between 7 to 10 business days to process your request once you’ve properly completed and submitted it. We disburse withdrawals each business day.
