You must create a user ID to log in securely to My Account. If you previously created a user ID and can’t remember it, you may be able to [recover your user ID online]({{ site.baseurl }}/access-your-account/request-your-account-information/).

You need your **TSP account number** and **web password** to create your user ID.

## Create user ID

<div class="steps" markdown="1">

1. Go to secure.tsp.gov to access My Account.
2. Select the link, **Create user ID.**
3. Enter your TSP account number and web password to log in.
4. You’ll need to complete two-step authentication if you have a validated phone number on your account.
5. Enter a user ID of your choice in the “User ID” box.
6. Enter your user ID again in the “Confirm User ID” box.
7. Select the **Submit** button.

You may need to answer your security challenge questions if you set those up in My Account before.

**You now have access to your account.** From now on, you’ll use your user ID and web password to log in to My Account on secure.tsp.gov.

**If you have both a civilian and uniformed services account,** your new user ID will apply to both accounts.
