We are pleased to announce the publication of the TSP's Fall 2010 poster "Will your numbers add up to a worry-free future?" In the current economy, this is a way to encourage participants to continue to contribute and build their TSP savings to reach their investment objectives.

The TSP will issue a supply of posters to all agency central distribution points. These will arrive shortly. Please contact your authorized agency representative to order print versions of these materials. Materials cannot be ordered directly from the TSP. The poster does not have an expiration date and can be displayed beginning immediately.
