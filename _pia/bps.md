## Overview

Business Process Services (BPS) enables the FRTIB to perform essential mission activities. This system facilitates the following business functions: (1) Data Collection; (2) Legal and Death Benefits Processing; (3) Reporting and Correspondence; and (4) Detecting Fraudulent Activity. The subsystems and applications within BPS that collect, use, or retain personally identifiably information (PII) will be detailed within their respective business functions.

1.	Data Collection   
FRTIB collects participant data through a variety of methods. FRTIB collects participant information from employing Federal agencies through a payroll data feed. Participants who are actively employed may amend their information in two ways: (1) by working with the payroll offices of their respective agency; and (2) by submitting forms available on tsp.gov to TSP. Upon separation from Federal employment, participants must submit account-related changes through forms obtained from tsp.gov. These forms are scanned and stored within the BPS applications. BPS also has an external connection with the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Demographics Mainframe application.

2.	Legal and Death Benefits Processing   
BPS processes a variety of information pertaining to legal issues and death benefits. When FRTIB receives a court order, FRTIB opens a case file in its Case Management System (CaMS) to process the court order as it applies to a participant’s account.

3.	Reporting and Correspondence   
This subsystem generates reports using participant data. The data generated is analyzed by authorized FRTIB employees and contractors and used to inform business decisions and respond to Executive Branch and Congressional Inquiries.

4.	Detecting Fraudulent Activity   
Applications within BPS help review forms collected by the system for potential fraud. Each distribution is checked for the likelihood that it is a fraudulent request.

## Authority

_FRTIB should only create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII if it has authority to do so, and any such authority should be identified in the appropriate notice._

The authorities that permit the collection and use of PII in BPS include:

+ Federal Records Act, _as amended_ (44 U.S.C. § 3101);
+ Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), _as amended_ (5. U.S.C. Chapter 84);
+ Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act (FERCCA) (114 Stat. 770); and
+ The Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act of 2009, Public Law 111-31.

## Purpose Specification & Use Limitation

_FRTIB should provide notice of the specific purpose for which PII is collected and should only use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII for a purpose that is explained in the notice and is compatible with the purpose for which the PII was collected, or that is otherwise legally authorized._

1. Purpose of the system   
BPS enables FRTIB to properly receive, administer, and maintain participant and beneficiaries’ TSP accounts. Demographic information is used to comply with the TSP Enhancement Act.

2. Intended use of PII   
The applications and subsystems within BPS use PII to securely facilitate the collection and use of payroll data, TSP forms and reports, correspondence, and legal and death benefit processing in order to administer the TSP. Additionally, the forms collected by BPS may be used internally as reference for Participant Services Representatives (PSRs) to help when responding to participant inquiries about their accounts.

3. Sharing of PII   
BPS has an external connection with the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Demographics Mainframe application to facilitate sharing accurate participant demographic information.

## Data Minimization

_FRTIB should only create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a legally authorized purpose, and should only maintain PII for as long as is necessary to accomplish that purpose._

1. Types of PII collected  
BPS collects participant and beneficiary names, addresses, dates of birth, dates of death, email addresses, SSNs, employment related information (e.g., pay grade, service completion date, etc.), and financial information (e.g., salary, plan contributions, account numbers, etc.). BPS also uses FRTIB employee and contractor user IDs to assign access privileges.

2. Records Retention   
TSP records must be retained for 99 years. Any records relating to the administration of a participant’s TSP account that are collected, used, or retained as part of BPS must comply with FRTIB’s retention schedule for TSP records.

## Individual Participation

_FRTIB should involve individuals in the process of using PII and, to the extent practicable, seek individual consent for the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, or disclosure of PII. FRTIB should also establish procedures to receive and address individuals’ privacy-related complaints and inquiries._

1. Notice and Opportunities for Consent   
Whenever possible, FRTIB provides notice to individuals about its policies regarding the use and disclosure of information at the time the information is collected. A Privacy Act Notice is provided on TSP forms that collect PII from participants or their beneficiaries.

2. Inquiries & Redress   
Although participants and their beneficiaries cannot directly access their information in BPS, they do have options to access information regarding their accounts or the TSP generally. Participants may access their account information via My Account in order to view their account information or make changes to their information. Participants may also call into FRTIB’s ThriftLine in order to speak with a PSR. Once the participant’s identity is authenticated, the PSR can provide a participant or beneficiary with information about his or her account.

## Data Quality & Integrity

_FRTIB should create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII with the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness reasonably necessary to ensure fairness._

1. Sources of PII   
Participants or their beneficiaries, as necessary, provide information on TSP forms available on tsp.gov. The completed forms include PII and sensitive account information, which is collected and reviewed by BPS. Court orders sent to FRTIB are scanned and processed through BPS. Participant data, including PII, is also collected from OPM’s Demographics Mainframe for additional reporting metrics.

## Security

_FRTIB should establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect PII commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from its unauthorized access, use, modification, loss, destruction, dissemination, or disclosure._

1. Authorization to Operate  
BPS was assessed and has a current Authority to Operate (ATO).

2. Safeguards  
BPS will only allow authorized users access to appropriate information and information systems. Access to the system is restricted to FRTIB employees and contractors whose responsibilities require access. Users are granted permission by system administrators or designated representatives in accordance with FRTIB’s policy regarding least privilege, need-to-know, and separation of duties. Access to all electronic records, including those maintained in BPS is limited to authorized users and is subject to network controls. FRTIB monitors and logs activity on FRTIB networks.

## Transparency

_FRTIB should be transparent about information policies and practices with respect to PII, and should provide clear and accessible notice regarding creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, and disclosure of PII._

1. Applicable SORN(s)  

   FRTIB-1: Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Records, available at 9 Fed. Reg. 21246 (April 15, 2014).

   FRTIB-12: Debt Collections Records, available at 81 Fed. Reg. 7106 (Feb. 10, 2016).

   FRTIB-13: Fraud and Forgery Records, available at 81 Fed. Reg. 7106 (Feb. 10, 2016).

2. Availability of Privacy Notices   
   Whenever possible, the FRTIB provides notice to individuals about its policies regarding the use and disclosure of PII at the time the FRTIB collects the information. The FRTIB forms that collect PII contain appropriate Privacy Act Notices. FRTIB provides additional notice to participants about how their information is used through its [System of Records Notices](/how-we-protect-your-data/system-of-records-notices/), and at [www.tsp.gov/privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/).

   When hired, and annually thereafter, all FRTIB federal employees and contractors are required to sign Rules of Behavior. The document explicitly notifies employees and contractors that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy while using FRTIB networks or devices and notifies employees and contractors that their activity is subject to monitoring. Users are also notified via a warning banner that their activity is monitored when logging into an FRTIB device.

## Accountability

_FRTIB should be accountable for complying with these principles and applicable privacy requirements, and should appropriately monitor, audit, and document compliance. FRTIB should also clearly define the roles and responsibilities with respect to PII for all employees and contractors, and should provide appropriate training to all employees and contractors who have access to PII._

1. Roles and Responsibilities  
Authorized employees and contractors within the Office of Participant Services, Office of Enterprise Planning, Office of General Counsel, and Office of External Affairs have access to BPS when necessary to perform their official duties.

2. Training  
All FRTIB employees and contractors with access to BPS must complete privacy awareness and security awareness trainings upon hire and annually thereafter. FRTIB’s privacy awareness training describes users’ responsibilities when handling PII and the penalties for mishandling privacy-sensitive data. FRTIB’s security awareness training describes information security best practices to be followed when using FRTIB systems and processing sensitive data. Users who do not complete required training are denied access to all FRTIB information systems.

3. Audit  
Activity on FRTIB networks, including BPS and its applications is monitored and logged to ensure information and information systems are used appropriately.
