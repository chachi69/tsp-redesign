# Changing your withdrawal

Once your withdrawal request is processed, you cannot return your withdrawal or change your withdrawal options. However, if you’ve chosen to receive part or all of your account in a series of monthly payments, you can change and manage those payments.

## Changing your monthly payment amount

Use the Change in Monthly Payment Amount form, [*Form TSP-73,*](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tsp-73.pdf) to do any of the following:

+ Change the monthly dollar amount you are receiving. You may do this once a year. Your request will become effective the following January; or
+ Change your TSP-computed payments (based on life expectancy) to a specific dollar amount. This is a one-time-only change. Your request will become effective the following January.

## Managing your monthly payments

Use the Monthly Payments Maintenance form, [*Form TSP-78,*](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tsp-78.pdf) to make the following immediate changes in the way your monthly payments are handled:

+ Start the direct deposit of your payments.
+ Change the financial institution or the checking or savings account that is receiving your monthly payments.
+ Stop direct deposit and have your monthly payment sent to you in the mail.
+ Change the standard federal tax withholding for your monthly payments.
+ Begin or stop transferring monthly payments to your IRA or eligible employer plan.
+ Change the portion of each monthly payment that is transferred to your IRA or eligible employer plan.
+ Change the IRA or eligible employer plan to which your payments are sent.

If you’ve chosen an annuity, you cannot change either the annuity option or your choice of joint annuitant after we’ve purchased the annuity for you. For more information about annuities, be sure to read [*Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service*](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk02.pdf).

## Requesting a final single payment

Use the Change From Monthly Payments to Final Payment form, [*Form TSP-79,*](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tsp-79.pdf) if you are receiving monthly payments and you want to request a final single payment from your TSP account. Your request for a final single payment will close your TSP account.
