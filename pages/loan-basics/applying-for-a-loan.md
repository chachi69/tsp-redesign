## Spousal rules
By law, your spouse has certain rights to your TSP account. When requesting a loan, you must indicate if you are married, even if you are separated from your spouse.
+ FERS or uniformed services participants: Your spouse must consent to your TSP loan by signing the Loan Agreement that you print from [My Account](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html).
+ CSRS participants: We must notify your spouse when you apply for a loan.

Exceptions to the spousal rule may be approved under very limited circumstances. For more information, please refer to [*Exception to Spousal Requirements*](#), Form TSP-16 ([TSP-U-16](#), for uniformed services members).
