## Overview

The ThriftLine Infrastructure System (TLI) provides key support to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board’s ThriftLine application. The ThriftLine is a toll-free number provided to Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) participants and their beneficiaries. The ThriftLine enables participants and their beneficiaries to access and manage their accounts, to conduct account transactions and to speak with Participant Service Representative (PSR) associates to answer their questions. While most participant data is processed by applications which are a part of the Participant Interaction Services (PIS) system boundary, the TLI system stores records of calls made to the ThriftLine and e-messages sent between participants and PSR associates.

## Authority

_FRTIB should only create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII if it has authority to do so, and any such authority should be identified in the appropriate notice._

Specific legal authorities and/or agreements permitting and defining the collection of information by the information system include:

- Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), _as amended_ (5 U.S.C. Chapter 84);
- Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act (FERCCA) 114 Stat. 770); and
- Federal Records Act, _as amended_ (44 U.S.C. § 3101).

## Purpose Specification & Use Limitation

_FRTIB should provide notice of the specific purpose for which PII is collected and should only use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII for a purpose that is explained in the notice and is compatible with the purpose for which the PII was collected, or that is otherwise legally authorized._

1. Purpose of the system   
TLI enables participants and their beneficiaries to access and manage their accounts, to conduct account transactions, and to communicate with PSR associates to answer their questions both over the phone and via the MyAccount<sup>1</sup> e-message tool.

2. Intended use of PII      
FRTIB records the content of all interactions between ThriftLine callers and PSR associates. The agency uses these call recordings to ensure PSR associates provide secure and high quality service to callers and to train PSR associates. The Agency may also access stored recordings to resolve account-related questions or discrepancies, and to address Congressional inquiries. Additionally, data collected through the e-messaging service is used to send and respond to participant and beneficiary inquiries through their MyAccount page.

3. Sharing of PII     
The Office of Participant Services (OPS) may provide participants copies of their call recordings if the participant submits a formal request.

## Data Minimization

_FRTIB should only create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a legally authorized purpose, and should only maintain PII for as long as is necessary to accomplish that purpose._

1. Types of PII collected  
As a part of routine operations, TLI uses and collects call recordings of interactions between callers to the ThriftLine and PSR associates, as well as from e-messages through MyAccount. Most of the call recordings or messages contain sensitive PII about participant and beneficiary accounts. This data may include, but is not limited to: the caller’s name; authentication information (e.g., SSN); TSP account number; home address and contact information; IP address; date of birth; and specific financial information related to or contained within his or her TSP account.

2. Records Retention   
TSP records, including the records in TLI, must be retained for 99 years. Any records relating to the administration of participant accounts that are collected, retained, or used by TLI must comply with FRTIB’s retention schedule for TSP documents.

## Individual Participation

_FRTIB should involve individuals in the process of using PII and, to the extent practicable, seek individual consent for the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, or disclosure of PII. FRTIB should also establish procedures to receive and address individuals’ privacy-related complaints and inquiries._

1. Notice and Opportunities for Consent   
When calling the ThriftLine, callers are notified that their calls may be monitored for quality assurance purposes. By subsequently providing information to the PSR associate during the course of the call, the caller consents to the system collecting information. Participants and beneficiaries access the e-messaging service by logging into their MyAccount on www.tsp.gov. When logging into MyAccount, there is a notice that alerts users that their activity is subject to monitoring. Furthermore, participants and beneficiaries are aware that their PII is being collected because they affirmatively provide it when composing the message.

2. Inquiries & Redress   
Participants and other authorized individuals may amend their account information by logging into their accounts through MyAccount on the TSP website. Additionally, participants and beneficiaries may also contact the ThriftLine again and speak with a PSR associate to verify the accuracy of their information and make any necessary changes to their account.

## Data Quality & Integrity

_FRTIB should create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII with the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness reasonably necessary to ensure fairness._

1. Sources of PII   
Information may be gathered from participants and beneficiaries directly as they call into ThriftLine or send inquiries via the MyAccount e-messaging service. TLI also pulls data from other FRTIB systems to access participant account information.
{:.alpha}

## Security

_FRTIB should establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect PII commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from its unauthorized access, use, modification, loss, destruction, dissemination, or disclosure._

1. Authorization to Operate  
TLI was assessed and has a current Authority to Operate (ATO).

2. Safeguards   
FRTIB will only allow authorized users access to appropriate information and information systems. Access to TLI is restricted to FRTIB employees and contractors whose responsibilities require access. Users are granted permission by system administrators or designated representatives in accordance with FRTIB’s policy regarding least privilege, need-to-know, and separation of duties. FRTIB maintains controlled access to all electronic records within FRTIB, including those maintained within TLI, alongside its network controls. Furthermore, FRTIB monitors and logs activity on its networks.
{:.alpha}

## Transparency

_FRTIB should be transparent about information policies and practices with respect to PII, and should provide clear and accessible notice regarding creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, and disclosure of PII._

1. Applicable SORN(s)  

   _FRTIB-1: Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Records_, available at 9 Fed. Reg. 21246 (April 15, 2014).

   _FRTIB-13: Fraud and Forgery Records_, is available at 80 Fed. Reg. 43428 (July 22, 2015).


2. Availability of Privacy Notices   
   Whenever possible, the FRTIB provides notice to individuals about its policies regarding the use and disclosure of PII at the time the FRTIB collects the information. The FRTIB forms that collect PII contain appropriate Privacy Act Notices. FRTIB provides additional notice to participants about how their information is used through its [System of Records Notices]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-we-protect-your-data/system-of-records-notices/), and at [www.tsp.gov/privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/).

   When hired, all FRTIB federal employees and contractors are required to sign Rules of Behavior as a condition of employment. The documents explicitly notifies employees and contractors that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy while using FRTIB networks or devices and notifies employees and contractors that their activity is subject to monitoring.
   {:.alpha}

## Accountability

_FRTIB should be accountable for complying with these principles and applicable privacy requirements, and should appropriately monitor, audit, and document compliance. FRTIB should also clearly define the roles and responsibilities with respect to PII for all employees and contractors, and should provide appropriate training to all employees and contractors who have access to PII._

1. Roles and Responsibilities  
Office of Technology Services (OTS), and its supporting contractors who have duties related to supporting TLI have access to the system. Office of Participant Services (OPS) employees and its supporting contractors whose job duties require access to call recordings and e-messages also have access to the recordings and messages.  

2. Training   
All FRTIB employees and contractors with access to TLI must complete privacy awareness and security awareness trainings upon hire and annually thereafter. FRTIB’s privacy awareness training describes users’ responsibilities when handling PII and the penalties for mishandling privacy-sensitive data.  FRTIB’s security awareness training describes information security best practices to be used when using FRTIB systems and processing sensitive data. Users who do not complete required training are denied access to all FRTIB information systems.

3. Audit   
Call recordings are routinely monitored to ensure the PSR associates adhere to security guidelines and provide appropriate service. The TLI system is regularly monitored and audit logs capture records of who has accessed recordings.
