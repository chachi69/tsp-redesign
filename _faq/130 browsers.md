TSP web pages and documents are best viewed with one of the following browsers:

- Microsoft Edge (current version with auto update enabled)
- Internet Explorer 11 (compatibility view disabled)
- Safari (current version with auto update enabled)
- Chrome (current version with auto update enabled)
- Firefox (current version with auto update enabled)

Older browsers often cannot support modern web standards and, in some cases, have been known to cause distortion of the information on the screen.

**Note**: for all browsers listed above, we recommend using the current version with auto update enabled.
