# Budget and Acquisition

FRTIB’s SAOP ensures that the Agency identifies and plans for the resources needed to implement its privacy program each year. The SAOP collaborates with members of FRTIB’s ELC to review IT capital investment plans and budgetary requests to ensure that privacy requirements and associated privacy controls are identified and collaborates with key stakeholders to ensure privacy risks are addressed to the maximum extent possible.
