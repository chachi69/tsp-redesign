**Senators introduce legislation on TSP withdrawal options** &#8212; At the TSP’s request, Senators Rob Portman and Tom Carper introduced a bill, S. 873, which would eliminate current statutory restrictions on participants’ withdrawal options. The bill would eliminate the restriction that participants cannot take partial post-separation withdrawals if they’ve already taken an age-based in-service withdrawal. It would also permit multiple post-separation withdrawals. Additionally, the bill would allow multiple age-based withdrawals while a participant is still working. Participants would also be able to stop monthly payments and elect to purchase an annuity while receiving monthly payments.
