You must create a user ID to log in securely to My Account and manage your Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account online. If you previously created a user ID and can’t remember it, you may be able to follow prompts to recover your user ID online.

**Note**: You need your **TSP account number** and **web password** to create your user ID.
