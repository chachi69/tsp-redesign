## CARES Act temporary loan and withdrawal options
The CARES Act allows us to offer temporary loan and withdrawal options to TSP participants affected by COVID-19. The loan options are now available. Favorable tax treatment of withdrawals you’re currently eligible for are also in effect. The TSP CARES Act withdrawal option will be available by late July 2020. **Both the loan and withdrawal options are available to you only if you can certify that you meet certain CARES Act criteria and TSP eligibility rules.**

## Payments you make to the TSP by check may take longer to process
Because of public health precautions being taken at our processing facilities, payments made by check will most likely take longer to appear in your TSP account. These include payments to make up missed loan payments, submit additional loan payments, or to roll over payments from IRAs or other employer plans. We appreciate your patience.

## Rollover period extended to July 15
If you received any withdrawal between February 1 and May 15 that is eligible for rollover, then the IRS has extended your 60-day rollover deadline to July 15th. If you received an RMD (or an installment payment that included an RMD) between February 1 and May 15, then you can roll those amounts over—to an IRA or eligible employer plan or back into your TSP account—provided that you do so by July 15th. Use Form TSP‑60. **You are eligible for this extended rollover period whether or not you have been affected by COVID-19.**

## Temporary waiver of notary requirement
We will temporarily accept and process certain TSP withdrawal and loan forms without requiring notarized signatures in order to support participants in physical distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. All signatures must be handwritten and submitted as directed in the form instructions, but you may leave the notary section blank.

## Temporary changes to required minimum distributions
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a steep and sudden decline in the stock markets and put a severe strain on many household budgets. As authorized by the recently enacted CARES Act, we’re making temporary changes related to required minimum distributions.
