# Agency and Service Representative resources

Welcome to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) website's special section for agency and uniformed services TSP representatives. This section contains **instructions and guidance for payroll, personnel, or other agency or services officials who are responsible for administering the TSP in their agencies or services.** This section should be used in conjunction with the main public TSP participant website, www.tsp.gov, which includes all current TSP bulletins and the TSP participant forms and products.

TSP trainers are available for webinars. See the TSP Webinars information for a list of webinars available for online registration. If you are an agency or service representative and would like to request a webinar for your employees, email training@tsp.gov with the text “webinar” in the subject line.

_Unfortunately, we are unable to accommodate requests for in-person events at this time._
