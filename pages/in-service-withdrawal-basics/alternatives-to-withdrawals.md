# Alternatives to withdrawals

You should consider the consequences before making an in-service withdrawal from your TSP account. If you're in pay status and are eligible for a TSP loan, you may want to consider that option. The following table compares how taking a TSP loan or making an in-service withdrawal would affect your account.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<th scope="col">Loan</th>
<th scope="col">In-Service Withdrawal</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="row" markdown="1">**Cost to Participant**</th>
<td markdown="1">
- $50 loan fee
- No earnings on any outstanding loan amount
</td>
<td markdown="1">
- Retirement savings permanently reduced by amount of withdrawal
- No future earnings on amount withdrawn
- With financial hardship withdrawal, no employee contributions for 6 months (and no matching contributions, if you are a FERS or BRS participant); members of the uniformed services cannot contribute from incentive, special, or bonus pay
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row" markdown="1">**Effect on Taxes**</th>

<li>Immediate tax liability (unless age-based withdrawal is transferred to an IRA or eligible employer plan)</li>

</ul>
</td>

\*When we report a taxable distribution, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers the unpaid balance (including any accrued interest) of the loan to be taxable income.
