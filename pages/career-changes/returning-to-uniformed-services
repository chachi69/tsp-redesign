# Returning to uniformed services

If you’ve reenlisted in, or been rehired by the uniformed services, there are a few things you need to know.

### The Blended Retirement System (BRS)


If you left the military prior to January 1, 2018 and rejoined after the blended retirement opt-in decision year, December 31, 2018, upon re-entry you will have 30 days to decide whether to stay in the legacy retirement system or elect the new BRS, so long as you previously met the criteria of having had fewer than 12 years of service as of December 31, 2017, or, for reservists or National Guard, had fewer than 4,320 retirement points as of December 31, 2017. 

However, if you re-enter military service in 2018, you will have the remaining time in calendar year 2018 or 30 days, whichever is longer, to make a decision to opt into BRS.


If you joined or re-joined on or after January 1, 2018, you were automatically enrolled in TSP and contribute 3% of your basic pay (or Inactive Duty Pay, sometimes referred to as Drill Pay in the National Guard and Reserve) starting with the pay period that begins on or after your 60th day of service. 

The government’s automatic 1 percent of basic pay will also begin with the pay period that begins on or after your 60th day of service, as measured from Pay Entry Base Date (PEBD). 

You may choose decline to be enrolled, or you may choose to begin contributing to TSP sooner than 60 days by completing the TSP-U1 form. The government will also match your contributions up to an additional 4 percent after two years of service. 

The maximum government contribution is 5 percent if you’re contributing 5 percent of your basic pay (see Chart 4-1). Both the DoD automatic 1 percent and the matching contributions continue through the end of the pay period through 26 years of service.
