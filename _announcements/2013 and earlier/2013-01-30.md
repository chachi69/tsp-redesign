The deadline has passed for "Hurricane Sandy" related financial hardship withdrawal requests. Previously, the TSP made temporary changes to the financial hardship withdrawal rules for participants affected by Hurricane Sandy. These changes allowed participants who were affected by Hurricane Sandy or who had a family member affected by Hurricane Sandy to take a hardship withdrawal and to continue making TSP contributions in the 6-month period after the hardship withdrawal. Participant requests must have been received by January 25, 2013 with distributions occurring by February 1, 2013.
