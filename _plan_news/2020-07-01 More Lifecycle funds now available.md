**More Lifecycle Funds now available** &#8212; As of July 1, 2020, you have ten Lifecycle (L) Funds to choose from instead of the five previously available. We added the additional L Funds so that the target dates will be separated by only five years instead of ten, allowing you to more precisely target the time when you think youâ€™ll need your money. Six more L Funds have been added, and the L 2020 Fund, having reached its target date, has been rolled into the L Income Fund.
