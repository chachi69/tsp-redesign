Annual TSP participant statements: We have begun mailing the 2008 annual participant statements. Over 4.2 million statements will be mailed, and we expect that mailing will continue through the end of February. The statements provide participants with a summary of the 2008 activity in their TSP accounts, as well as a number of other features, such as their personal rates of return, the amount of their lifetime contributions, the amount that they contributed toward various contribution limits, and their beneficiaries of record. A copy of the leaflet How to Read Your Annual Participant Statement is enclosed with the mailing to help participants understand the statements. Also, a set of Questions and Answers, which supplement the leaflet, are on the TSP Web site. The mailing also includes a letter from the Executive Director reviewing last year's TSP activities and discussing upcoming events, a copy of the January/February 2009 Highlights, and a leaflet summarizing the results of the 2008 TSP survey. This year, participants were given the opportunity to opt out of the mailed annual statement. Those individuals who opted out will still receive a mailing that includes all four enclosures.
