This is a reminder that agencies should NOT accept completed [TSP-3]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-3.pdf), _Designation of Beneficiary_, forms from employees. All TSP-3s should be sent directly to the TSP’s Service Bureau at Thrift Savings Plan, P.O. Box 38502, Birmingham, AL 35238, or faxed to 1-866-817-5023, not filed in employee eOPFs.

If the TSP Service Bureau has a valid Form TSP-3 on file on or before the date of the participant’s death, the TSP will use the form to identify the participant’s beneficiary(ies) and disburse the death benefit payments from his or her TSP account(s). If the TSP Service Bureau does not have a valid TSP-3 on file, the death benefit payment will be paid by Statutory Order of Precedence (SOP) as listed on the TSP-3 form.
