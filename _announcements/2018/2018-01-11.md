The TSP has created an onboarding video and a complementary one-page information sheet titled “Welcome to the TSP!” which are designed to educate new federal employees about the TSP. These two products are part of the Agency Communications and Education (ACE) toolkit designed to assist agencies in their efforts to educate employees on the benefits of TSP participation. You can find the video and one-pager along with posters created for the ACE toolkit at tsp.gov in the Information for Agency/Service Representatives section by visiting the [Media gallery]({{ site.baseurl }}/agency-service-reps/media-gallery/).
