If you successfully complete the entire loan process online and are approved, you’ll receive your money within 7–10 business days in the form of a check mailed to the address we have on file for you. You will not have the option of receiving your money by electronic funds transfer (EFT).

If you submitted a paper loan agreement, your request make take several weeks to process.

You may track the [status of your loan]({{ site.myaccount }}/loan.do?subaction=menu&amp;_name=loan){:target="\_blank"} online or by [contacting us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).
