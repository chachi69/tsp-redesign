You can choose between two tax treatments for your TSP contributions:

## Traditional contributions

Traditional contributions
are made before taxes are
taken out, which means you’ll
pay taxes when you withdraw
your money.

## Roth contributions

With Roth TSP contributions, you pay the taxes up front, so during retirement, you’ll receive qualified Roth distributions tax-free.<sup>[1](#foot_1)</sup>

To help you decide which contributions are right for you, check out our videos, “Is Roth TSP Right For Me?” for [civilian]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=150){:rel="nofollow"} and [uniformed services]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=151){:rel="nofollow"} at [youtube.com/tsp4gov]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=152){:rel="nofollow"}.  You also may want to try our [Contribution Comparison Calculator]({{ site.baseurl }}/calculators/contribution-comparison-calculator/){:rel="nofollow"}.

You can make both traditional **and** Roth contributions if you want. You can contribute in any percentages or amounts you choose subject to IRC limits and change your election at any time.

If you're FERS or BRS, your Agency/Service Matching Contributions are based on the total amount of money (traditional and Roth) that you contribute each pay period. All agency/service contributions are deposited into your traditional balance.
