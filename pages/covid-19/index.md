<h1><div class="nav-header">COVID-19</div>Latest information</h1>

Updated **January 5, 2021**.

**Plan news and reminders related to <span class="nobr">COVID-19</span>**

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act included several important provisions for TSP participants:

- It waived required minimum distributions (RMDs) for the year 2020 for all TSP participants who would otherwise have been subject to RMDs, including those who would not have been required to receive one until April 1, 2021.
- It temporarily doubled the maximum amount that COVID-affected TSP participants could borrow from their accounts.
- It allowed COVID-affected TSP participants to suspend TSP loan payments for the year 2020.
- It authorized us to create a special withdrawal type for COVID-affected participants.
- It provided favorable tax treatment for COVID-affected participants who made a withdrawal from their accounts in 2020.

You can read the news items below for more information about how we carried out these provisions of the CARES Act.

The deadlines for the increased loan maximum, for suspending loan payments, and for taking withdrawals that are covered by the CARES Act have passed. If you took a withdrawal from your TSP account in 2020, visit [Withdrawals and repayments]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-19/withdrawals-and-repayments/) to learn more about the favorable tax treatment provided by the CARES Act, including whether your withdrawal is eligible and, if so, how to take advantage of it.
