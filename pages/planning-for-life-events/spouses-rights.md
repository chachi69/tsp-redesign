# Spouse's rights

Your spouse has certain rights regarding your TSP account.

- If you request a loan or withdrawal and you're a FERS employee or member of the uniformed services, your spouse must consent to your request in writing.
- If you request a loan or withdrawal and you're a CSRS employee, your spouse must be notified of your request.

- If youâ€™re unable to obtain your spouse's consent or provide your spouse's address for notification, you may submit Form TSP-16, [*Exception to Spousal Requirements*]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-16.pdf), ([TSP-U-16]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-u-16.pdf) for uniformed services). These exceptions are rarely granted and you must provide documentation.
