# L 2040

The L 2040 Fundâ€™s investment objective is to achieve a high level of growth with a low emphasis on preservation of assets. The Fund's allocation in the G, F, C, S, and I Funds is adjusted quarterly. The L 2040 will roll into the L Income Fund automatically in July 2040 when its allocation becomes the same as the allocation of the L Income Fund.

You should consider investing in the L 2040 Fund if you plan to withdraw money from your TSP account beginning 2035 through 2044.
