Join the FRTIB on Wednesday, September 12, at 1:00 p.m., Eastern time, for an exclusive webinar, "Roth TSP for H.R. Professionals."

This presentation will explain the new Roth TSP option. The presenters will explain how Roth contribution elections are made, how Roth balances will be treated within the account, and what conditions must be satisfied in order to enjoy tax-free treatment of withdrawals. The program will also highlight some of the major differences between Roth TSP, traditional tax-deferred TSP, and Roth IRAs, and will include a preview of the soon-to-be-released video, "Is Roth Right for Me?" The information is intended to prepare human resources professionals to answer basic employee questions about the mechanics of Roth TSP.

The deadline for registration has passed.

Due to the limitation on the number of registrants, participation in this event is only being offered to agency and service TSP representatives, payroll professionals, and uniformed services financial counselors. Rest assured, however, that a considerable amount of Roth-related information is available to all our TSP participants, and even more is on the way.
