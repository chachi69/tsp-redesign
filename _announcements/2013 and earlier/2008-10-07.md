Federal employees who want to receive their annual TSP participant statements only on the web can now opt out of receiving mailed annual statements. They can do this in the Account Access section of the TSP Web site, on the ThriftLine, or through a participant service representative. However, participants who opt out of mailed annual statements will still receive the annual TSP mailing with the letter from the Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board and a copy of the latest _Thrift Savings Plan Highlights_ in the mail.
