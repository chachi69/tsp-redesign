# How Much Can I Contribute?

Each year the IRS determines the maximum amount you can contribute to tax-deferred savings plans like the TSP. This is known as the [IRS elective deferral limit](javascript:void(0)). Participants should use this calculator to determine the specific dollar amount to be deducted each pay period in order to maximize your contributions and to ensure that you do not miss out on Agency or Service Matching Contributions if you are entitled to them.
