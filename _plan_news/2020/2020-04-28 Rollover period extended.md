**Rollover period extended to July 15** &#8212; If you received any withdrawal between February 1 and May 15 that is eligible for rollover, then the IRS has extended your 60-day rollover deadline to July 15th. If you received an RMD (or an installment payment that included an RMD) between February 1 and May 15, then you can roll those amounts over—to an IRA or eligible employer plan or back into your TSP account—provided that you do so by July 15th. Use Form TSP‑60.
