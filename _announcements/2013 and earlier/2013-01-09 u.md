The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board invites members of the uniformed services to join us for an exclusive webcast, _Roth TSP for Uniformed Service Members_, Part II at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday, January 17, 2013.

This presentation will follow up on the webinar of the same title recorded on December 19, 2012. Panelists from the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board will review the basics of the new Roth TSP option, and then address the many questions that uniformed services members submitted during the December program. The discussion will include the limits on contributions, the differences between Roth TSP and Roth IRAs, transferring Roth balances into and out of the TSP, and the rules for qualified withdrawals. The information is intended to help uniformed services members make decisions about participating in the Roth TSP.

Since the questions for this discussion have been pre-selected from those submitted during the December webinar, the panel will not be responding to new questions.

The deadline for registration has passed.
