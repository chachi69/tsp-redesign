# Designating beneficiaries

Upon your death, the money in your beneficiary participant account cannot stay with us. The remaining funds will be distributed this way:

1. To your spouse
2. If none, to your child or children equally, and to the descendants of deceased children
3. If none, to your parents equally or to your surviving parent
4. If none, to the appointed executor or administrator of your estate
5. If none, to your next of kin who is entitled to your estate under the laws of the state you lived in at the time of your death

For most people, this is a good option, since it accounts for changes like births, deaths, divorce, or marriage that may happen long after you open your account.

If you'd like to make an exception, you may complete [Designation of Beneficiary](#), _Form TSP-3_. Note: We will not honor a will or a prenuptual agreement. 

If you don’t remember whether you’ve submitted a Form TSP-3 or you’re not sure who you named as your beneficiaries, look at your annual statement, check the online wizard, or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778.  Even if you’re certain your designated beneficiaries are current, check them periodically.
