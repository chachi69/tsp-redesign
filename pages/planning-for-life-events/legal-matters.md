# Legal matters

## TSP account garnishment for alimony or child support

You may be required to pay alimony or child support from your TSP account. If we receive a complete, qualifying legal process for garnishment of your TSP account for alimony or child support, we will freeze your account, preventing any loans or withdrawals. The freeze will be removed when payment has been made, or when we receive an order to remove the freeze.

Be sure to read *[Court Orders and Powers of Attorney](javascript:void(0))* for a complete understanding of your rights and responsibilities.
