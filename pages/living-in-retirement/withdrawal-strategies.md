# Withdrawal strategies

Leaving federal service doesn’t mean you have to leave the TSP. By keeping some or all of your TSP savings with us, you can continue to accrue earnings, diversify your savings through interfund transfers, and benefit from some of the lowest administrative costs in the world. 

We offer several options for withdrawing the money from your account. When making your decision, it's important to think about your income needs and the lifestyle you would like to have in retirement. The approach you take to withdrawing your TSP account depends on your specific goals. Here are some things to consider:

+ **You may need money right away for an important purchase.** If you need a portion of your TSP savings right away, but want to leave the rest to continue growing, consider taking a partial withdrawal.
+ **You may want to avoid paying taxes for as long as possible.** If you want to avoid paying taxes on the money in your TSP account for as long as possible, be sure not to take any withdrawals until the IRS requires you to do so. By law, you are required to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) beginning the year you turn 70½. At that time, you'll have to pay taxes at your ordinary income tax rate on any taxable income you receive from your TSP account.  
+ **You may want to receive a payment every month.** You may decide that you want income from your TSP account every month. Be aware that neither the specified dollar amount nor the TSP-computed monthly payment options are guaranteed to last your entire lifetime. You may want guaranteed income to last your lifetime. If you want a guaranteed stream of monthly income, you may consider purchasing a life annuity, which is a monthly benefit paid to you every month for the rest of your life. This process can sometimes be complicated but we’ve got you covered. Visit [Annuity basics](#) for information on purchasing an annuity. 

For detailed information about your withdrawal options, read the booklet [Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service](#).

For more information about RMDs and tax requirements, see the TSP tax notice "[Important Tax Information About Your TSP Withdrawal and Required Minimum Distributions](#)".
