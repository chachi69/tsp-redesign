Uniformed services participants who opted into the Blended Retirement System (BRS) and did not have a TSP account prior to opting in should visit their service’s payroll system to make a contribution election. Once a member opts in, the service creates a TSP account for him or her and begins making Service Automatic (1%) Contributions. However, any service member who didn’t already have a TSP account will need to go into the payroll system and select the percentage of pay to contribute to his or her TSP account in order to start making employee contributions and receive Service Matching Contributions.

Participants can complete Form [TSP-U-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-u-1.pdf){:.pdf} file if they cannot access their payroll system.
