The Thrift Savings Plan has launched the “Stay” campaign to highlight the benefits of staying with the TSP after leaving federal service. In addition to a special poster for distribution at federal agencies and services, we’ve created an interactive website. The site includes two educational videos, a special leaflet, and questions participants might have for other financial institutions. While each individual’s situation is different and should be considered when making this decision, our goal is to help provide the tools participants need to make the best choice for themselves.
