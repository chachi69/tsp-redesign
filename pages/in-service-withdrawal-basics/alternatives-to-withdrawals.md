# Alternatives to withdrawals

You should consider the consequences before taking a TSP loan or making an in-service withdrawal from your TSP account. If you're in pay status and are eligible for a TSP loan, you may want to consider that option. The following table compares how taking a TSP loan or making an in-service withdrawal would affect your account.

|   | **Loan** | **In-Service Withdrawal** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**Cost to Participant**  |- $50 loan fee |- Retirement savings permanently reduced by amount of withdrawal |
|  |- No earnings on any outstanding loan amount |- No future earnings on amount withdrawn |
|  |   |- With financial hardship withdrawal, no employee contributions for 6 months (and no matching contributions, if you're a FERS or BRS participant); uniformed services members cannot contribute from incentive, special, or bonus pay  |
|**Effect on Taxes** |-None (unless loan is not paid back and we report a taxable distribution*) |- Immediate tax liability (unless age-based withdrawal is transferred to an IRA or eligible employer plan) |
|   |   |- Possible additional 10% early withdrawal penalty tax |
|**Effect on Earnings** |-No earnings on amount of loan until funds are repaid |- No earnings on amount withdrawn |
 |   |   |- With financial hardship withdrawal, no new contributions to accrue earnings for 6 months
|**Effect on Matching Contributions (FERS and BRS Only)** |- None |-With financial hardship withdrawal, no matching contributions while employee contributions are suspended  |

*When we report a taxable distribution, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers the unpaid balance (including any accrued interest) of the loan to be taxable income.
