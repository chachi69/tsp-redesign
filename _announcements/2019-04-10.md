**Clarification of TSP Bulletin 19-1, Effect of the retroactive pay increase on the Thrift Savings Plan** – In the guidance we provided in [Bulletin 19-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/bulletins/19-1/), we indicated that if you need to submit contributions associated with the retroactive pay increase, you should do so on current payment records (12 or 16-Record) using the current pay date. We have been notified by some agencies that certain limitations may prevent them from submitting the contributions in this way. If it is not possible for you to submit these contributions on current payment records using the current pay date, you may use the “as of” date instead. But note that using the “as of” date for these contributions could result in breakage. Payroll offices can contact Agency Technical Services (ATS) for clarification or with questions.
