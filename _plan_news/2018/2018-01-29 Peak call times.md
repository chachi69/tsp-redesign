**Peak ThriftLine Call Times &#8212; Our highest call volume is on Monday and Tuesday mornings.** If you want to minimize your wait time to speak to a Participant Services Representative, consider calling outside of those peak hours. Participant Service Representatives are available Monday through Friday, <span class="nowrap">7:00 a.m.</span> to <span class="nowrap">9:00 p.m.</span>, eastern time.
