[Bulletin 14-1](/bulletins/14-1.pdf)

Under the provisions of Title 5 U.S.C. ยง 8350, Federal employees who are designated by their agencies to furnish information on retirement benefits are required to complete related training on an annual basis. In order to help our agency/service partners satisfy this requirement, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) offers Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) training courses throughout the year.
