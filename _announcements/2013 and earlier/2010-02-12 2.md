Annual TSP participant statements: Over 4.3 million statements have been mailed. The statements provide participants with a summary of the 2009 activity in their TSP accounts, as well as a number of other features, such as their personal rates of return, the amount of their lifetime contributions, the amount that they contributed toward various contribution limits, and their beneficiaries of record. The leaflet How to Read Your Annual Participant Statement helps explain the information on the statement. The mailing also includes a letter from the Executive Director reviewing last year's TSP activities and discussing upcoming events, as well as a copy of the January/February 2010 Highlights. Those individuals who opted out of receiving mailed annual statements will still receive a mailing that includes all of the enclosures.
