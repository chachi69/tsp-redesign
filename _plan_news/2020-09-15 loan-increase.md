**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; The CARES Act allowed us to temporarily [increase the maximum loan amount]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-19/loans/) on general purpose loans for qualified individuals. If you plan to apply for a loan with the increased maximum, **we must receive your completed application on or before September 22, 2020.** The online application tool in My Account will come down at noon that day. We can accept signed loan agreements until midnight that night.
