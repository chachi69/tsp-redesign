**Current loan interest rate** &#8212; The interest rate on your TSP loan is the G Fund rate at the time your loan application is processed. The current rate is 3.125%. We are working to resolve a technical issue that may cause a different rate to show when using our Loan wizard. If you generated a loan agreement on or after November 2, 2018 but before December 1, 2018, be sure to check that the interest rate on your loan agreement is 3.125% before submitting.
