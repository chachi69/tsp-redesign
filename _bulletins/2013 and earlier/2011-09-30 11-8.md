With the implementation of the TSP Roth feature in second quarter 2012, the various reports that payroll offices receive from the Thrift Savings Plan record keeping system, as well as those reports that are available on an ad hoc basis through the Web-based data submission and reports retrieval application (Web-based application), will be updated to incorporate the Roth contributions and associated transactions.
