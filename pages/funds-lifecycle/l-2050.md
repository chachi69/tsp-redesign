# L 2050

The L 2050 Fundâ€™s investment objective is to achieve a high level of growth with a very low emphasis on preservation of assets. The Fund's allocation in the G, F, C, S, and I Funds is adjusted quarterly. The L 2050 will roll into the L Income Fund automatically in July 2050 when its allocation becomes the same as the allocation of the L Income Fund.

You should consider investing in the L 2050 Fund if you plan to withdraw money from your TSP account beginning 2045 or later.
