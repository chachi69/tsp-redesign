# Administrative costs

Our expenses are the costs of administering your TSP. The **gross** expenses include

* the costs of operating and maintaining the our recordkeeping system,
* the cost of providing participant services, and
* the printing and mailing of notices, statements, and publications.

These expenses are paid by the forfeitures of Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions of FERS and BRS participants who leave federal service before they are vested, other forfeitures, and loan fees. Because these amounts are not sufficient to cover all of the TSP's expenses, you share in the remainder of the costs.

**Net** expenses represent the amount that your investment returns were reduced by TSP administrative expenses.

__For 2018, the average net expense for participants was $.040* for every $1,000 invested.__

Expense ratios may also be expressed in basis points. One basis point is 1/100th of one percent, or .01%. Therefore, the 2018 net expense ratio* of .040% is 4 basis points. Expressed either way, this means that expenses charged to your account in 2018 were approximately 40 cents per $1,000 of investment.

\*_Other expenses are fees paid to the investment manager._
