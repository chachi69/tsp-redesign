**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; Starting in January 2021, the process for catch-up contributions will be easier for TSP participants. If you’re turning age 50 or older, you’ll no longer need to make separate catch-up elections to your TSP account to contribute toward the [catch-up limit]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/catch-up-contributions/).

Here’s how it will work:

- If you reach the [IRS elective deferral or annual addition limit]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/contribution-limits/) before the end of the year and keep saving, your contributions will automatically continue toward the [catch-up limit]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/contribution-limits/).
- Contributions spilling over toward the catch-up limit will qualify for the match on up to 5% of salary.
- The contribution amount you choose will continue each year [unless you change it]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/).
