# Spouse's rights

Your spouse has certain rights regarding your TSP account.

Any time you request a loan or withdrawal:

- Your spouse must consent to your request in writing, if you are a FERS employee or member of the uniformed services.
- Your spouse must be notified of your request, if you are a CSRS employee.

If youâ€™re unable to obtain your spouse's consent or provide your spouse's address for notification, you may submit [Exception to Spousal Requirements](/funds/tsp-16), Form TSP-16 ([TSP-U-16](/funds/tsp-u-16.pdf), for uniformed services). These exceptions are rarely granted and you must provide documentation.
