# Start, change, or stop contributions

In most cases, you'll use your agency's or service's electronic payroll system to start, change, or stop your TSP contributions.

For example, civilian payroll systems include [Employee Express]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=7){:rel="nofollow"}, EBIS/GRB, [LiteBlue]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=8){:rel="nofollow"}, [myPay]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=6){:rel="nofollow"}, and [NFC EPP]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=9){:rel="nofollow"}.

Uniformed services can use [myPay]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=6){:rel="nofollow"} (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps) or [Direct Access]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=47){:rel="nofollow"} (Coast Guard and NOAA Corps).

USPHS Commissioned Corps needs to fill out the paper forms and not the electronic payroll system.

### Does your agency accept paper forms?

Download [Form TSP-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-1.pdf), _Election Form_ ([TSP-U-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-u-1.pdf) for uniformed services members), or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to have it mailed to you.

## I was just hired. Am I already contributing?

If you were hired or rehired on or after October 1, 2020, you were automatically enrolled in the TSP at 5% of your salary. You are [getting the full match]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/maximize-your-savings/) from your agency or service. If you decrease your employee contribution amount below 5%, you will not receive the full amount of agency money. If you stop making regular employee contributions, your matching contributions will also stop.
