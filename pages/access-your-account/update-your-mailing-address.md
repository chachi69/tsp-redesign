Keeping your address up to date with us is important. How you change your address with us depends on whether or not you still work for the federal government.

**If you’re currently a federal employee**, report your correct address to your agency. We can’t accept address changes directly from you.

**If you're an active or a Ready Reserve member of the Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marine Corps**, you can update your address through the [myPay]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=6){:rel="nofollow"} website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the &#8220;Correspondence Address&#8221; section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.

Members of the Coast Guard and NOAA Corps can use [Direct Access]({{ site.baseurl }}/exit/?idx=47){:rel="nofollow"}. Select &#8220;Home and Mailing Address&#8221; under Tasks, then choose &#8220;TSP&#8221; from the drop-down menu next to &#8220;Address Type.&#8221;

**If you’re no longer a federal employee or uniformed services member**, visit [My Account: Profile Settings]({{ site.profile_settings }}){:target="\_blank"} to change the address. Or while you’re logged in, use our [Form TSP-9]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-9.pdf&_form=tsp09), _Change in Address for Separated Participants_, and upload your form in My Account, or fax or mail it to us.

To change or validate your phone number or email address, visit [My Account: Profile Settings]({{ site.profile_settings }}){:target="\_blank"}.
