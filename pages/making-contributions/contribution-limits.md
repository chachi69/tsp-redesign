# Know your limits

Each year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines the limit of contributions, also called elective deferrals, you can make to your TSP account. Below are the **2020** IRS limits and additional information to keep you informed.

**Select an option and take a look.**

## All ages
This limit applies to the **combined total of traditional and Roth contributions.** For uniformed services members, this does not apply to traditional contributions from combat-zone pay.

Contributing from your pay before taxes allows your money to grow tax-deferred until you withdraw it. If you make Roth (after-tax) contributions, those contributions could be "qualified" and tax free at retirement. Knowing this limit helps you decide how much to put away each year.

Additionally, this limit does not include matching contributions that you receive from your agency or service, so you're actually saving more.

If you're not maxing out your contributions, consider increasing your contribution amount each chance you get to help reach your retirement savings goals. You might be surprised how big of a difference a small increase can make.

## Age 50 and over

At any time beginning in the year you turn 50, you have the opportunity to **make additional contributions above the IRS' elective deferral limit.** These "catch-up contributions" provide a chance to put away extra money for retirement, even if you're not behind.

Catch-up contributions are made on top of your regular employee contributions; however, they do not receive any matching. To be eligible to make these special contributions, you must be on track to meet the IRS elective deferral limit.

## All Ages

The annual addition limit is the **total amount of all the contributions you make in a calendar year.** This limit is per employer and includes money from all sources: employee contributions (tax-deferred, after-tax, and tax-exempt), Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, and Agency/Service Matching Contributions.

The annual addition limit affects mostly members of the uniformed services who can exceed the annual elective deferral limit. The excess contributions go into the traditional portion of your account from tax-exempt pay earned in a combat zone.

**Are you about to max out? Be careful not to exceed the contribution limits before December 31. If you do, we won't be able to process any more of your contributions for the remainder of the year, which means you'll miss out on Matching Contributions.**
