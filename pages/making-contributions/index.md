# Making contributions

If you're a brand new federal employee, your agency or service has automatically enrolled you in the TSP, and 3% of your basic pay is deducted from your paycheck each pay period and deposited in the traditional balance of your account. Many people who were automatically enrolled decide to increase their contributions to at least 5% of their salary to get the full match from their agency or service.
