The TSP is providing two new sources of information—a fact sheet and a video—about the new Blended Retirement System (BRS) to be implemented on January 1, 2018. The information is meant to help members of the uniformed services who will have fewer than 12 years of service on December 31, 2017, decide whether to opt into BRS or stay with their current system. See the fact sheet _Questions and Answers about Opting into the Blended Retirement System (BRS)_ and the video “_Opting into the Blended Retirement System (BRS)_.”
