# Purchase an annuity

## Step one

Before completing the necessary forms to purchase your annuity, you should read the booklet, *[Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk02.pdf).* **Once your request has been processed and the balance is removed from your TSP account, you cannot change or cancel the annuity.**

## Step two

If you've determined that an annuity is appropriate for your needs, complete [Request for Full Withdrawal](#), _Form TSP-70_. Be sure to read the form and instructions carefully as they outline specific requirements you must meet in order to avoid any unnecessary delays in processing. There is a $3,500 minimum amount required to purchase an annuity. If you're using only a portion of your account for an annuity, the percentage of your account that you choose must equal $3,500 or more of your vested account balance.

If you have both a traditional balance and a Roth balance in your account, the $3,500 minimum applies to each balance separately. If you meet the minimum for both, we will purchase two identical annuities - one with traditional money and one with Roth.

After we receive all of the information and documentation necessary to purchase your annuity, it will generally take 10-12 business days to process your request and send your funds.
Your annuity will be purchased from our our competitively chosen annuity provider.

Once the funds have been disbursed, you cannot cancel your annuity, change your annuity option, or change your joint annuitant.

## Step four

Once the money has left your TSP account, you should direct all communications concerning your annuity to the annuity provider. The provider will send you a package of information and an annuity contract. Your monthly annuity payments will begin approximately one month after the annuity is purchased.
