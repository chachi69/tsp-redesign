# Historical information on contribution limits

The TSP provides agency and service representatives with historical information on contribution rules, limits, and eligibility determination. This page also provides agency representatives with sample language notifications they may use to inform newly hired or rehired FERS and CSRS employees of the benefits of participation in the TSP.
