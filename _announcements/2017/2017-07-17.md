Payroll and Human Resource Specialists,

The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is conducting a brief survey to determine how well we are doing and how we can best support you. Your feedback will help us create training sessions that are relevant to your needs, and implement ways to make our sessions more convenient for you to attend, either remotely or in person.

Please click here to complete the survey: http://www.questionpro.com/t/ALKFtZaHDG. The survey will take you approximately 10 minutes to complete, and will close on August 5, 2017.

If you have any questions about this survey please contact us at training@tsp.gov. Thank you for helping us serve you better.

Sincerely,

The Thrift Savings Plan Training and Education Team
