# Privacy Control Requirements

FRTIB has implemented NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4 to ensure compliance with applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements with respect to information security. The Privacy Division is in the process of finalizing privacy controls for FRTIB’s information systems in compliance with NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4 Appendix J. FRTIB also adheres to Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002, which requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA) for electronic systems and collections.  The Privacy Division conducts an initial analysis, known as a privacy threshold analysis (PTA) of each of FRTIB’s electronic systems to determine whether a PIA is required. Finally, FRTIB ensures compliance with the Privacy Act by publishing System of Records Notices (SORN) in the Federal Register.
