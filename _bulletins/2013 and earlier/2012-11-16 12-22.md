The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced the contribution limits for 2013. These limits affect the amount of contributions participants can make to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for the year. The annual limit for elective deferrals will increase from $17,000 in 2012 to $17,500 in 2013. Also, the limit for catch-up contributions will remain at $5,500 in 2013. For TSP purposes, elective deferrals refer to employee contributions that are made as traditional (tax-deferred) and/or Roth.
