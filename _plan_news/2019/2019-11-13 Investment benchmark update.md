**Investment benchmark update** &#8212; At its November meeting, Members of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board affirmed the 2017 decision to move to a new index for the International Fund (I Fund) for the Thrift Savings Plan. In coming to this decision, the Board noted that moving to the broader I Fund benchmark is in the best interest of participants and beneficiaries, a current best practice in the investment industry, and is widely recognized as a smart strategy in today’s market. The ten largest U.S. companies’ 401(k) plans all invest in emerging markets, as do the ten largest federal contractor plans and the six largest target date fund providers. In addition, the 20 largest defined benefit plans—all of which are for state government workers—invest in emerging markets. TSP participants can decide which TSP funds they want to invest in.
