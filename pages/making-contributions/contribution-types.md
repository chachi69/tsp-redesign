# Contribution types

## Regular Employee Contributions

Each pay period, your agency or service will deduct your contribution from your basic pay in the amount or percentage that you chose when you started contributing (or at 3% of your pay if you were automatically enrolled and haven't made any changes).

Your agency or service will continue to deduct your contribution until you do the following:

## Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions

If you are a FERS or BRS employee, your agency or service will contribute an amount equal to 1% of your basic pay each pay date to your TSP account. These are called Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions and you don’t need to make employee contributions to receive them.

**Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions are not taken out of your
pay and do not reduce your pay for income tax purposes.**

### A Few Words about Vesting
{: .card-title}

Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions are subject to vesting
rules. You are vested in (entitled to keep) all of your Agency/Service
Automatic (1%) Contributions, as well as any earnings that they accrue,
aer a certain period of federal service. In order to count toward vesting, the years of service must be in a position that is eligible to participant in the TSP, not just the years in which you were a participant.



Most FERS participants are vested in automatic contributions aer
completing 3 years of service. BRS members and FERS employees in
congressional and certain non-career positions become vested aer
2 years of service.

If you leave federal service before satisfying the vesting requirement,
the Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions and their earnings
will be forfeited to the TSP.

If you die before separating from service, you’re automatically
considered vested in all the money in your account.

## Agency/Service Matching Contributions

If you are a FERS or BRS participant, you will receive Agency/Service Matching Contributions from your agency or service based on your regular employee contributions once you are eligible. Unlike Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, Matching Contributions are not subject to vesting requirements.

As a FERS or BRS participant, you receive matching contributions on the first 5% of pay that you contribute each pay period.

| Your Biweekly Contribution | Automatic 1% Contribution | Agency Matching Contribution | Total Contributions |
| --- | --- | ---| ---|
| 0% | 1% | 0% | 1% |
| 1% | 1% | 1% | 3% |
| 2% | 1% | 2% | 5% |
| 3% | 1% | 3% | 7% |
| 4% | 1% | 3.5% | 8.5% |
| 5% | 1% | 4% | 10% |
| 5% + | 1% | 4% | 5% + |

The first 3% of pay that you contribute will be matched dollar-for-dollar; the next 2% will be matched at 50 cents on the dollar. Contributions above 5% of your pay will not be matched. If you stop making regular employee contributions, your matching contributions will also stop.

## Catch-up Contributions
Starting in the year you turn 50, you may be eligible to make catch-up
contributions to your TSP account in addition to your regular employee
contributions.


**Here’s what you should know:**
- You must already be contributing an amount that will reach the IRS annual
contribution limit. To see the most current limits, visit [Contribution Limits](#).
- You may start, change, or stop making catch-up contributions at any time.
- There are no matching contributions for catch-up contributions.
- You must make a new election each calendar year—they do not restart
automatically.

**Uniformed services members can use tax-exempt pay to make catch-up
contributions, but not incentive pay, special pay, or bonus pay.**

To make a catch-up contributions, use your agency’s or service’s payroll website
(e.g., Employee Express, myPay, LiteBlue, EBIS, or NFC-EPP) or complete Form
TSP-1-C, Catch-Up Contribution Election (or TSP-U-1-C for uniformed services)
and submit it to your payroll office. Download the [form](#) or call the ThriftLine
at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to request a copy.

## A Note for Members of the Uniformed Services

**If you are a member of the uniformed services:**

* You can contribute from **1 to 100** percent of any incentive pay, special pay,
or bonus pay (even if you’re not currently receiving them)— as long as you
elect to contribute from your basic pay.
* You cannot contribute from sources such as housing or subsistence
allowances.
* Contributions from tax-exempt pay will also be tax-exempt.

**Note:** If you contribute tax-exempt pay, your total contributions from all types
of pay must not exceed the IRS annual addition limit for the year.
