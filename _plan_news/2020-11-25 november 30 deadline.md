**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; The CARES Act allowed participants to suspend payments on TSP loans for the rest of calendar year 2020. If you plan to suspend your remaining 2020 loan payments, **we must receive your completed TSP-46 application on or before November 30, 2020.** We will not accept any applications received after 11:59 PM that day.
