# Update your address

How you change your address with us depends on whether or not you still work for the federal government.

**If you’re currently a federal employee**, report your correct address to your agency. We can’t accept address changes directly from you.

**If you're an active member of the Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marine Corps**, you can update your address through the [myPay](https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx){:target="\_blank"} website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address. Members of the Coast Guard and NOAA Corps can use [Direct Access](https://portal.direct-access.us/){:target="\_blank"}. Select "Home and Mailing Address" under Tasks, then choose "TSP" from the drop-down menu next to "Address Type."

**If you’re no longer a federal employee or uniformed services member**, visit [My Account: Profile Settings](#) to change the address. Or while you’re logged in, use our [Change in Address for Separated Participants](/PDF/forms/tsp-9.pdf), *Form TSP-9*, and fax or mail it to us.

To change or validate your contact information such as your phone number or email address, visit [My Account: Profile Settings](#).
