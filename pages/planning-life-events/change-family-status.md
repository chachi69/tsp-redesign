# Changes in your family status
 
## Marriage
 
Be sure to inform us if your name or mailing address changes. 
 
If you’re currently a federal employee, report these changes to your agency or service. 
 
If you’re no longer a federal employee, visit [My Account:Profile Settings](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html) to change your address, or call the ThriftLine.

If you’re an active duty uniformed services member, log into the myPay website and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. Note: If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.
 
## Spouse's rights

Your spouse has certain rights regarding your TSP account.
Any time you request a loan or withdrawal:
* Your spouse must consent to your request in writing, if you are a FERS employee or member of the uniformed services.
* Your spouse must be notified of your request, if you are a CSRS employee.
 
If you’re unable to obtain your spouse's consent or provide your spouse's address for notification, you may submit Form TSP-16, Exception to Spousal Requirements (TSP-U-16, uniformed services). These exceptions are rarely granted and you must provide documentation. 
 
## Divorce, annulment, and legal separation

Your current or former spouse, or your dependents, could be awarded a portion of your TSP account if a valid Retirement Benefits Court Order (RBCO) to divide your account is issued.  The RBCO can be issued at any time in the divorce, annulment, and separation proceedings.
 
**The rules for qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) that apply to private sector plans do not apply to the TSP.** 
 
A valid RBCO will require us to freeze your account, preventing you from taking any new loans or withdrawals until the award is paid out or the order is otherwise resolved. However, a freeze will not prevent you from making contributions or changing your contribution allocation or investment choices, and you will still be required to make payments on existing loans.
 
Be sure to read Court Orders and Powers of Attorney for a complete understanding of your rights and responsibilities.
 
 
## TSP account garnishment for alimony or child support

You may be required to pay alimony or child support from your TSP account. If we receive a complete, qualifying legal process for garnishment of your TSP account for alimony or child support, we will freeze your account, preventing any loans or withdrawals. The freeze will be removed when payment has been made, or when we receive an order to remove the freeze.
Be sure to read [Court Orders and Powers of Attorney](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk11.pdf) for a complete understanding of your rights and responsibilities.
