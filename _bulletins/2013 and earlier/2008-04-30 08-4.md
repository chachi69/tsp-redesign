The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) has announced a change to the interfund transfer (IFT) program
which will impose limits on the IFT requests a participant may make each month. The final
regulation for the IFT limit was published in the _Federal Register_ on April 24, 2008; the change
will be implemented on May 1, 2008.
