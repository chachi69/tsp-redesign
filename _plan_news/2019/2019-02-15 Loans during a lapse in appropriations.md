**Loans during a lapse in appropriations** &#8212; As a result of the recent partial government shutdown, we made changes to provide assistance to affected TSP participants. In the event your agency is affected by a lapse in appropriations, read the fact sheet [Frequently Asked Questions About TSP Loans During a Lapse in Appropriations]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspfs13.pdf) file for details on how to take a loan, what to do if a lapse in appropriations lasts long enough to affect your loan payments, and other questions you may have about taking or having a loan while you are on shutdown furlough. The fact sheet also explains what happens with your loan payments when a lapse in appropriations ends.
