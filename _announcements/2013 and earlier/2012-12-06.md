The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board invites members of the uniformed services to join us for an exclusive webinar, _Roth TSP for Uniformed Services Members_, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, December 19, 2012.

This presentation will explain how the new Roth TSP option applies to members of the uniformed services. A panel from the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board will explain the basics of the new Roth TSP option, how Roth balances will be treated within the account, what conditions must be satisfied in order to enjoy tax-free treatment of withdrawals, and how to get started. The panelists will also highlight some of the major differences between Roth TSP, traditional tax-deferred TSP, and Roth IRAs, and will answer selected questions from attendees. The information is intended to help members of the uniformed services make decisions about participating in the Roth TSP.

The deadline for registration has passed.
