Did you know if your account balance is $200 or more, you can keep it in the TSP when you leave the federal government?

Once you leave the federal government, you’ll no longer be able to make employee contributions. However, you can still change your investment mix, transfer eligible money into your account, and enjoy our low costs—all while your account continues to accrue earnings.

As you prepare to leave federal service, here are four important things you must do:

- Make sure the TSP has your [current address]({{ site.baseurl }}/account-basics/update-personal-information/) at all times.
- If you have any TSP loans, pay them off within 90 days of your separation.
- Read _[Withdrawing From Your TSP Account for Separated and Beneficiary Participants](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk02.pdf)_ to fully understand your options.
- Read the tax notice "[Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tsp-536.pdf)."

Did you know if your account balance is $200 or more, you can keep it in the TSP when you leave the federal government?

Once you leave the uniformed services, you’ll no longer be able to make contributions. However, you can still change your investment mix, transfer eligible money into your account, and enjoy our low costs—all while your account continues to accrue earnings.

As you prepare to separate from service, here are some important things you must do:

- Make sure we have your [current address]({{ site.baseurl }}/account-basics/update-personal-information/) at all times. While you’re an active duty service member, you can update your address through the MyPay website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.
- If you have any TSP loans, pay them off within 90 days of your separation.
- Read _[Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspbk02.pdf)_ to fully understand your options.
- Read the tax notice "[Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tsp-536.pdf)."
- Read [*TSP Benefits That Apply to Members of the Military Who Return to Federal Civilian Service*]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspfs08.pdf) to fully understand all of your rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
