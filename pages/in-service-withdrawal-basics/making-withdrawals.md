# Making an in-service withdrawal

## Applying for a financial hardship withdrawal or an age-based withdrawal

+ To apply for a financial hardship withdrawal, log in to [My Account: Withdrawals](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html) and click “Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawal."
+ To apply for an age-based withdrawal, log in to [My Account: Withdrawals](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html) and click “Age-Based In-Service Withdrawal.”

You can submit your request online unless you are required to obtain your spouse's signed consent or you want to receive your money by direct deposit to your bank account.

If you have a pending application for an in-service withdrawal or for a TSP loan at the time we receive your request, it will not be accepted. We allow only one request for an in-service withdrawal or loan at a time.




## Receiving your in-service withdrawal

We will mail your in-service withdrawal check to the address we have on record, unless you request to have your withdrawal payment electronically deposited into your checking or savings account.

+ If you're transferring any portion of your age-based withdrawal, we will mail the check to your IRA or eligible employer plan.

+ If you complete your request online, we cannot deposit your money electronically or transfer any part of your withdrawal to an eligible employer plan.

It will take several weeks from the time we receive your properly completed form until the time we send your check.

To find out the status of your in-service withdrawal, visit [My Account](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html) or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778. We will also notify you in writing when your request has been processed.
