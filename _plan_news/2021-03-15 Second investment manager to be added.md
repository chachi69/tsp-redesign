**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; Starting in April 2021, the FRTIB will begin transferring some of the assets in the C, S, and F Funds from BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., to State Street Global Advisors Trust Company. Having two investment managers allows each to serve as a backup to the other. We expect that the transfers will be complete by the end of June 2021. We will update tsp.gov and our educational materials to reflect the addition of the second manager as the transfers are made. The transfers will not affect your ability to make changes to your TSP account.
