# Breach Response and Management

FRTIB has an obligation to protect the information TSP participants, beneficiaries, and others entrust to the Agency. The Privacy Division takes this obligation very seriously and has developed a policy and procedures to inform FRTIB employees and contractors of their obligation to protect PII and to instruct them specific steps they must take in the event there is an actual or potential compromise of PII. FRTIB’s process for responding to a breach of PII are part of the Agency’s formal Incident Response Policy and Procedures and is based on OMB Memorandum 17-12, Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information and requires:

- All FRTIB employees and contractors to immediately report any potential or actual incidents to FRTIB’s Incident Response Team (IRT) as soon as they become aware that an incident may have occurred;
- The IRT to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the potential incident and further requires the SAOP or her designee to investigate whether PII was potentially or actually compromised;
- The SAOP to determine which remediation methods should be used in the event of an actual compromise of PII based on the type of harm caused to the individual(s);
- The IRT to conduct after action reports for high- and moderate-risk incidents that document the details of the incidents and the steps taken to remediate the gaps that caused the incident to occur; and
- To conduct an annual table-top exercise, which consists of a structured, readiness-testing activity that simulates an actual incident involving PII designed to prepare key stakeholders and decision-makers for an emergency situation involving a data breach.
