In July 2009, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and agencies implemented the provision of Public Law 111-31, the Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act of 2009, which authorized immediate agency contributions for TSP participants covered by the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS) and other equivalent retirement plans. Although the year-to-date growth rate of 6.4% for contributing FERS participants is the highest it has been since 1999, the number of non-contributing FERS employees has increased approximately 73,000 between July and December. Our goal now is to encourage these new participants to begin saving for their retirement and taking advantage of the Agency Matching Contributions they are currently “leaving on the table.”
