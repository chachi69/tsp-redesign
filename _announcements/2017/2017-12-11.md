The TSP has created a TSP-3 wizard available at www.tsp.gov. It is located on the "My Account” page under “Personal Information” via the link titled “Beneficiaries.” This wizard helps participants and beneficiaries designate or change their beneficiary information if they desire a distribution other than the statutory order of precedence. The wizard populates the TSP-3 with the information that participants enter and helps them to avoid common mistakes that could cause the form to reject. Upon completion, participants should print the form and submit it to the TSP by mail or fax.

Form TSP-3, Designation of Beneficiary, has been revised, and the 05/2017 version is available for download from the TSP website. Earlier editions of the form are obsolete. Agencies that maintain an inventory of TSP forms should destroy or recycle previous editions of the form. Agencies that make forms available electronically should take down obsolete editions. Participants who prefer completing the paper version of the form should download and print the form from the TSP website at the time they need it to ensure they are submitting a current, valid version.
