The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board has modified the attached Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) fact sheet, _Effect of Nonpay Status on your TSP Account_, to highlight procedures required by participants and agency representatives to suspend loan payments during the period that a participant is placed in nonpay status. Agency representatives should provide a copy of this fact sheet when a participant is placed in nonpay status.
