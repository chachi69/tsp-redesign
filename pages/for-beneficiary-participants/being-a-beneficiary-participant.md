At any time beginning in the year you turn 50, you have the opportunity to **make additional contributions above the IRS' elective deferral limit.** These "catch-up contributions" provide a chance to put away extra money for retirement, even if you're not behind.

Contributing from your pay before taxes allows your money to grow tax-deferred until you withdraw it. If you make Roth (after-tax) contributions, those contributions could be "qualified" and tax free at retirement. Knowing this limit helps you decide how much to put away each year.

Additionally, this limit does not include matching contributions that you receive from your agency or service, so you're actually saving more.

## All Ages
The annual addition limit is the **total amount of all the contributions you make in a calendar year.** This limit is per employer and includes money from all sources: employee contributions (tax-deferred, after-tax, and tax-exempt), Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, and Agency/Service Matching Contributions.

The annual addition limit affects mostly members of the uniformed services who can exceed the annual elective deferral limit. The excess contributions go into the traditional portion of your account from tax-exempt pay earned in a combat zone.

## Combining your TSP accounts

If you have an existing TSP account from your own employment with the federal government or the uniformed services, you can move your beneficiary participant account (BPS) into your existing TSP account by completing Form TSP-90, Withdrawal Request for Beneficiary Participants. The money you move will be treated as an employee contribution, but it will not be subject to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) annual elective deferral limit. (See the instructions on Form TSP-90 for more information on combining accounts.)

In general, once you combine your BPA with your existing TSP account, your BPA money will be subject to the rules that govern the account to which it was moved.
If both accounts contain Roth contributions, the Roth Initiation Date that will apply to your combined account is the earlier of the two. If only one of the accounts contains Roth money, the Roth Initiation Date associated with that account becomes the date for your combined account.

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert-info">
  <div class="usa-alert-body"><h3 class="usa-alert-heading">If you have Roth money in your BPA</h3><p class="usa-alert-text">The earnings on that money qualify to be paid tax-free if 5 years have passed since January 1 of the calendar year when the first Roth contribution was made. But once you move your beneficiary participant account to your own account, the following rule also applies in order for your Roth earnings to qualify for tax-free withdrawal: You must be 59½, permanently disabled, or deceased.</p></div>
</div>


If your BPA resulted from a uniformed services TSP account and the account contains tax-exempt money from combat pay, those funds cannot be transferred into your civilian TSP account. In this case, the tax-exempt funds will be distributed directly to you. Check your quarterly or annual statements to see whether your BPA account contains tax-exempt money.

**Note:** You **cannot** move an existing TSP account into your beneficiary participant account. And if you have more than one beneficiary participant account, you cannot combine them. Also, if you have an IRA or other retirement plan, you will not be able to transfer or roll over those funds into your beneficiary participant account.
