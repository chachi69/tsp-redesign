# L 2020

The L 2020 Fundâ€™s investment objective is to achieve a moderate level of growth with a moderate emphasis on preservation of assets. The Fund's allocation in the G, F, C, S, and I Funds is adjusted quarterly. The L 2020 will roll into the L Income Fund automatically in July 2020 when its allocation becomes the same as the allocation of the L Income Fund.

You should consider investing in the L 2020 Fund if you plan to withdraw money from your TSP account beginning 2019 through 2024.

<!--- Scott and LP, I think just the charts/visuals from here: https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_L2020.html should be included but I'm unsure how we go about that. --->
