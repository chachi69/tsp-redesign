# Administrative costs
If you’re looking for the best place to save and invest for your retirement, your search could be over. The TSP is a better, less expensive home for your retirement savings.

Like private sector 401 (k) plans, administering the TSP involves many kinds of expenses, and these expenses are passed on to you. But the TSP has built a solid group of investment funds that provide a broad diversification, at remarkably low cost. This is one of the reasons record numbers of you have been transferring money into the TSP from IRAs and other eligible employer plans, and you’re also keeping it in the TSP when you leave federal service.

The TSP expenses are the costs of administering your TSP. The gross expenses include:
* The costs of operating and maintaining the TSP's recordkeeping system,
* The cost of providing participant services, and
* The printing and mailing of notices, statements, and publications.

Expenses are offset by the forfeitures of Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions of FERS and BRS participants who leave federal service before they are vested, other forfeitures, and loan fees. Because these amounts are not sufficient to cover all of the TSP's expenses, TSP participants share in the remainder of the costs.

__For 2017, the average TSP net expense for participants was $.033* for every $1,000 invested.__
The TSP net expense ratio represents the amount that participants' investment returns were reduced by TSP administrative expenses. Expense ratios may also be expressed in basis points. One basis point is 1/100th of one percent, or .01%. Therefore, the 2017 TSP net expense ratio* of .033% is 3.3 basis points. Expressed either way, this means that expenses charged to each TSP account in 2017 were approximately 33 cents per $1,000 of investment.

*Fees associated with securities lending are not included in 2017 administrative expenses. Consistent with standard practice in the industry, they are charged in addition to administrative expenses. Other expenses are disclosed in the financial statements and are available in the April 2018 [*Highlights.*](https://www.tsp.gov/forms/newsletterArchive.html)
