The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Agency) has made a number of changes to the TSP post-separation withdrawal process to provide for notarized spouse and participant signatures and to reduce the number of forms rejected because they are incomplete or invalid. Changes include the consolidation of Form TSP-70, Request for Full Withdrawal (civilian) and Form TSP-U-70 (uniformed services) into a single form; and Form TSP-77, Request for Partial Withdrawal When Separated (civilian), and Form TSP-U-77 (uniformed services) into a single form, effective May 7, 2012.
