## Overview

Core Recordkeeping Services (CRS) provides the following services for the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB): Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) recordkeeping activities; summary reporting of daily TSP processing; reconciliation details reporting; participant transaction notices; and participant statements. CRS consists of multiple subsystems and applications that collect, use, and retain PII. Applications within CRS are grouped by subsystems based on technical functionality. CRS includes:

1. Correspondence Subsystem &#8212; The correspondence subsystem within CRS is responsible for formatting and printing account statements that FRTIB sends to TSP participants. These include reports of changes participants have made to their accounts; financial account statements, including fund balances and disbursements; information about loans; and other informational notices the Agency periodically sends to TSP participants.

2.	Reports Subsystem &#8212; This subsystem generates reports used by FRTIB employees and contractors to oversee and administer the TSP. FRTIB regularly creates a variety of reports to track daily transactions; participant activities and projections; data related to administration of the G fund; and information used to balance and validate deliverables.

3.	Omni Subsystem &#8212; This subsystem contains FRTIB’s primary recordkeeping applications for TSP account information, including participant PII. Omni contains the recordkeeping software that manages and stores participant data. It also retains data collected by other TSP applications and is designed to update participant account information, as well as to ensure the information is available for proper use in other applications. Omni Security is a component of Omni that enables authorized FRTIB employees and contractors to access participant data.

## Authority

_FRTIB should only create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII if it has authority to do so, and any such authority should be identified in the appropriate notice._

The authorities that permit the collection and use of PII for CRS include:

- Federal Records Act, _as amended_ (44 U.S.C. § 3101);
- Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), _as amended_ (5. U.S.C. Chapter 84); and
- Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act (FERCCA) (114 Stat. 770).
- The Thrift Savings Plan Enhancement Act of 2009, Public Law 111-31

## Purpose Specification & Use Limitation

_FRTIB should provide notice of the specific purpose for which PII is collected and should only use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII for a purpose that is explained in the notice and is compatible with the purpose for which the PII was collected, or that is otherwise legally authorized._

1. Purpose of the system   
CRS enables FRTIB to properly administer and track TSP account information, as well as regularly communicate account information and general updates with its participants.

2. Intended use of PII   
CRS applications use PII to administer participant accounts, generate reports, and to share data between FRTIB systems to validate data.

3. Sharing of PII   
Some CRS applications share PII outside FRTIB. CRS has an Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) with the Agency’s print-mail vendor. The purpose of this interconnection is to enable FRTIB’s print-mail vendor to send statements and other communications to FRTIB participants.

## Data Minimization

_FRTIB should only create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish a legally authorized purpose, and should only maintain PII for as long as is necessary to accomplish that purpose._

1. Types of PII collected  
For participants and their beneficiaries, CRS  collects and uses names, addresses, dates of birth, dates of death, email addresses, SSNs, employment related information (e.g., pay grade, service completion date, etc.), and financial information (e.g., salary, plan contributions, account numbers, etc.). CRS also uses FRTIB employee and contract user IDs to assign access privileges.

2. Records Retention   
TSP records must be retained for 99 years. Any records relating to the administration of a participant’s TSP account that are collected, used, or retained as part of CRS must comply with FRTIB’s retention schedule for TSP records.

## Individual Participation

_FRTIB should involve individuals in the process of using PII and, to the extent practicable, seek individual consent for the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, or disclosure of PII. FRTIB should also establish procedures to receive and address individuals’ privacy-related complaints and inquiries._

1. Notice and Opportunities for Consent   
   Federal employees in the FERS retirement system and members of the uniformed services who began serving on or after January 1, 2018 are automatically enrolled in the TSP. The participant’s employing agency or service provides participants with relevant information about the TSP.
   <p>Federal employees in the CSRS retirement system and members of the uniformed services who began serving before January 1, 2018 are enrolled in the TSP after making a contribution election. The form used to make a contribution election contains a Privacy Act Notice.</p>
2. Inquiries & Redress   
Participants and beneficiaries have several options to access information regarding their accounts and the TSP. Participants may access their account information via My Account in order to view or make changes to their account and to view their information. Participants may also call into FRTIB’s ThriftLine in order to speak with a PSR associate. Once the participant’s identity is authenticated, the PSR associate can assist with information about his or her account. Additionally, PSR associates can mail account specific information to participants.

## Data Quality & Integrity

_FRTIB should create, collect, use, process, store, maintain, disseminate, or disclose PII with the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness reasonably necessary to ensure fairness._

1. Sources of PII   
CRS pulls and uses information from multiple internal and external sources. CRS connects with the other FRTIB systems, Interfacing Services System (ISS) and Business Process Services (BPS), in order to process and confirm information, including PII. CRS also collects information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in order to generate demographics reports.

## Security

_FRTIB should establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect PII commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from its unauthorized access, use, modification, loss, destruction, dissemination, or disclosure._

1. Authorization to Operate  
CRS was assessed has a current Authority to Operate (ATO).

2. Safeguards  
CRS will only allow authorized users access to appropriate information and information systems. Access to the system is restricted to FRTIB employees and contractors whose responsibilities require access. Users are granted permission by system administrators or designated representatives in accordance with FRTIB’s policy regarding least privilege, need-to-know, and separation of duties. FRTIB maintains controlled access to all electronic records within FRTIB, including those maintained within CRS, alongside its network controls. Furthermore, FRTIB monitors and logs activity on FRTIB networks.

## Transparency

_FRTIB should be transparent about information policies and practices with respect to PII, and should provide clear and accessible notice regarding creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, and disclosure of PII._

1. Applicable SORN(s)  
   <p>FRTIB-1: Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Records, available at 9 Fed. Reg. 21246 (April 15, 2014).</p>

2. Availability of Privacy Notices   
   Whenever possible, the FRTIB provides notice to individuals about its policies regarding the use and disclosure of PII at the time the FRTIB collects the information. The FRTIB forms that collect PII contain appropriate Privacy Act Notices. FRTIB provides additional notice to participants about how their information is used through its [System of Records Notices](/how-we-protect-your-data/system-of-records-notices/), and at [www.tsp.gov/privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy/).
   <p>When hired, and annually thereafter, all FRTIB federal employees and contractors are required to sign Rules of Behavior. The document explicitly notifies employees and contractors that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy while using FRTIB networks or devices and notifies employees and contractors that their activity is subject to monitoring. Users are also notified via a warning banner that their activity is monitored when logging into an FRTIB device.</p>

## Accountability

_FRTIB should be accountable for complying with these principles and applicable privacy requirements, and should appropriately monitor, audit, and document compliance. FRTIB should also clearly define the roles and responsibilities with respect to PII for all employees and contractors, and should provide appropriate training to all employees and contractors who have access to PII._

1. Roles and Responsibilities  
Multiple offices within FRTIB have roles within CRS processing and handling reports including: the Office of Communications and Education (OCE), the Office of Technology Services (OTS), the Office of Enterprise Planning (OEP), and the Office of Participant Services (OPS). Additionally, certain forms and mailings are externally shared with FRTIB’s print-mail vendor.

2. Training  
All FRTIB employees and contractors with access to CRS must complete privacy awareness and security awareness trainings upon hire and annually thereafter. FRTIB’s privacy awareness training describes users’ responsibilities when handling PII and the penalties for mishandling privacy-sensitive data.  FRTIB’s security awareness training describes information security best practices to be used when using FRTIB systems and processing sensitive data. Users who do not complete required training are denied access to all FRTIB information systems.

3. Audit  
Activity on FRTIB networks, including CRS and its applications is monitored and logged to ensure information and information systems are used appropriately.
