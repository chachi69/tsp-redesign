## Definitions and eligibility
To be eligible for the CARES Act loan options, you must be a **qualified individual**. You’re a qualified individual if you meet at least one of the following criteria listed in the CARES Act. When you apply for either loan option, you are self-certifying that you meet one or more of these conditions. To protect your privacy, do NOT send supporting documentation with your application, especially medical information.

- You have been diagnosed with the virus SARS–CoV–2 or with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) by a test approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
- Your spouse or dependent (as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) has been diagnosed with such virus or disease by such a test.
- You are experiencing adverse financial consequences as a result of being quarantined, being furloughed or laid off or having work hours reduced due to such virus or disease, being unable to work due to lack of child care due to such virus or disease, closing or reducing hours of a business owned or operated by the individual due to such virus or disease, or other factors as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate).

## Increased maximum loan amount
The maximum loan amount on a general purpose loan is increased from $50,000 to $100,000, and the portion of your available balance you can borrow is raised from 50% to 100%. **All of the other rules on TSP loans apply, including that you may not have more than one general purpose loan at the same time. A loan with the increased maximum amount allowed under the CARES Act is still a general purpose loan**. To apply, [log in to My Account and use the online tool]({{ site.loans }}). The deadline for applying is September 18, 2020.

## Temporary suspension of loan payments
You may suspend your obligation to make payments on your TSP loan or loans for the rest of calendar year 2020. This applies to existing loans and loans taken between now and November 30, 2020. To apply, complete and submit [Form TSP-46]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-46.pdf), _CARES Act Loan Suspension Request_. Carefully read all of the instructions on the form before submitting. . If you are thinking of getting another loan in 2020 in addition to placing your current loan on suspension, request the new loan first so that the suspension can be applied to both loans. Note that you may only have one residential loan and one general purpose loan at one time.


## Using both loan options
If you are thinking of getting another loan in 2020 in addition to placing your current loan on suspension, request the loan first so that the suspension can be applied to both loans.
