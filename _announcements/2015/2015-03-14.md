The TSP has retired Form TSP-U-17, Information Relating to Deceased Participant, formerly used to report the death of a uniformed services participant to the TSP. Effective March 14th, 2015, Form TSP-17 (civilian) and TSP-U-17 (uniformed services) have been consolidated into a single [TSP-17]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-17.pdf). The combined form supersedes all prior versions of Forms TSP-17 and TSP-U-17 with dates prior to March 2015, and all previous versions of either form should be discarded.

As with previous versions, Form TSP-17 should be submitted directly to the TSP. Only one Form TSP-17 needs to be submitted on behalf of a deceased participant, even if multiple beneficiaries are involved or when the deceased participant had multiple TSP accounts (e.g. civilian, uniformed services, and/or BPA accounts).
