Effective the date of the implementation of the TSP Roth feature on May 7, 2012, Form TSP-U-50, Investment Allocation, will be obsolete. We are asking services to destroy (recycle) any copies of the form they may possess effective that date. The TSP will not honor a form received from either the participant or their service after the Roth implementation date.
