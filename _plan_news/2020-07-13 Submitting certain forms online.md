**{{ page.title }}** &#8212; You may now submit certain TSP forms online by logging in to My Account and uploading a PDF copy of the form. Youâ€™ll find an up-to-date list of forms we accept online when you log in to My Account and select **Upload Form** from the menu. That section provides detailed instructions on how to prepare your file for upload.

You still have the option to mail or fax your completed form and supporting documentation to us. However, be sure to submit your form and documentation **one time only**. We will process the first submission we receive and cancel any subsequent forms of the same type.
The list of forms you can submit online may change at any time, so be sure to check the list in My Account before you begin preparing your file.
