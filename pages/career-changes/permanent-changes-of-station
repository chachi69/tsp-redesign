# Permanent Changes of Station (PCS)

If you’re making a permanent change of station (PCS) there are a few things you should consider.

As you prepare to PCS:
+ Make sure we have your current address at all times. While you’re an active duty service member, you can update your address through the MyPay website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.
+ Be sure to read “Buying a home” if you’re buying a new home and plan on taking a TSP residential loan.
+ If you have any TSP loans, continue to make your loan payments at your new station or location. You must make up, from your own funds, any loan payments you may have missed. Mail a loan payment directly to the TSP along with Form TSP-26, Loan Payment Coupon.
+ If your PCS includes a career change, you may consider making a change to your contributions to [maximize your savings].
+ Contact your service’s human resource office to ensure that your TSP contributions resume and are being deducted from your pay. You can discuss any changes you may have with them as well.
+ Read the tax notice Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account.
+ Read the fact sheet TSP Benefits That Apply to Members of the Military Who Return to Federal Civilian Service to fully understand all of your rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
