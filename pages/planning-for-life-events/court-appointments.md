# Court appointments

A guardian or conservator has a court-ordered authority to act for a participant or beneficiary who is deemed incapacitated or incompetent.

If we receive a qualifying court order authorizing another individual to act on a participant (or beneficiary's) behalf,  we will not accept any documents signed by the participant (or beneficiary) after the date of that court order.

Read _[Court Orders and Powers of Attorney](javascript:void(0))_, which explains the rules for establishing a guardianship or conservatorship.
