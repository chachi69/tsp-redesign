On Wednesday, March 12, 2008, the OPM sponsored a FERCCA meeting for Payroll Representatives in New Orleans, LA. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board attended this meeting and reviewed TSP corrections under the provisions of FERCCA. A copy of the updated TSP FERCCA corrections slides with attachments is available for Payroll representatives not able to attend this meeting and HR representatives processing FERCCA corrections.
