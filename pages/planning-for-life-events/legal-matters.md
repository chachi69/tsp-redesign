# Legal matters

## TSP account garnishment

You may be required to pay alimony or child support from your TSP account. If we receive a complete, qualifying legal process for garnishment of your TSP account for alimony or child support, we will freeze your account, preventing any loans or withdrawals. The freeze will be removed when payment has been made, or when we receive an order to remove the freeze.

Be sure to read *[Court Orders and Powers of Attorney](javascript:void(0))* for a complete understanding of your rights and responsibilities.

## Power of attorney

You can use a Power of Attorney (POA) to authorize another person (the “agent”) to act on your behalf.
A POA may be general, giving your agent unlimited power to conduct business with the TSP.
Or, a POA may choose specific tasks that the agent can do on your behalf, such as obtain information about your account, or borrow or withdraw funds from your account.

You can use the [Special Power of Attorney](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/oc01-10.pdf) form to designate a power of attorney.

Be sure to read _[Court Orders and Powers of Attorney](javascript:void(0))_ for a complete understanding of these issues, particularly the sample language for granting a power of attorney.

## Court appointments

A guardian or conservator has a court-ordered authority to act for a participant or beneficiary who is deemed incapacitated or incompetent.

If we receive a qualifying court order authorizing another individual to act on a participant (or beneficiary's) behalf,  we will not accept any documents signed by the participant (or beneficiary) after the date of that court order.

Read _[Court Orders and Powers of Attorney](javascript:void(0))_, which explains the rules for establishing a guardianship or conservatorship.
