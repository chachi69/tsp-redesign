# Entering a nonpay status

## What is nonpay status?

Nonpay status is when active federal government employees, including the uniformed services, do not receiving regular pay because of furlough, suspension, leave without pay (including leave without pay to perform military duty).

Here are some things you can expect while you’re in nonpay status:

## What stays the same?

* You can continue to make interfund transfers (IFTs). You can also make contribution allocation changes that will take effect once you return to pay status, or when you make future loan payments to your account.
* You can transfer or roll over money into your TSP account from traditional IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and eligible employer plans.
* You can request a financial hardship or age-based in-service withdrawal, if you're eligible.

## What changes?

### All accounts
* You will not be able to contribute because your employee contributions are made through payroll deductions.
* You will not be eligible to request a new TSP loan.

### Uniformed services accounts

* If you're a civilian employee in nonpay status to perform military service, you may make contributions to your uniformed services account from your uniformed services pay.
* You will not receive Agency Contributions in your uniformed services account, but when you return to civilian pay status, you may be entitled to make up TSP contributions to your civilian account (and receive restored Agency Contributions, if you are a FERS employee).
* If you're a Blended Retirement System (BRS) participant, you will receive Service Automatic (1%) Contributions and Service Matching Contributions, if eligible. Your reclaimed agency contributions to your civilian account will be reduced accordingly.

For more information, read the fact sheet [TSP Benefits That Apply to Members of the Military Who Return to Federal Civilian Service](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspfs08.pdf).

### FERS employee accounts

* You will not receive <span data-term="Agency Matching Contributions" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">Agency Matching Contributions</span> (which are based on your employee contributions).

* You will not receive <span data-term="Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions</span>, which are calculated on basic pay earned each pay period.

## What are the effects of nonpay status on my contributions and loans?

* If you make employee contributions based on a **percentage** of your basic pay and your income decreases during the pay period, your contributions would automatically decrease by an equal percentage. However, if you make contributions based on a **dollar amount**, that amount would not automatically decrease with the reduction in pay.
* If you don’t earn enough per pay period for your agency to deduct the required loan payment from your pay because of a furlough, you would be responsible for ensuring your TSP loan payments are up to date.
