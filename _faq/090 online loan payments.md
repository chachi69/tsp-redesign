No, you cannot make loan payments online. When we pay out your loan, we will notify your payroll office immediately to begin deducting loan payments from your salary each pay period.

Check your leave and earnings statement to be sure that loan payments have started and that they are in the correct amount. Contact your agency or service if payments have not started or if they’re in the wrong amount.

Be aware that you’re responsible for the repayment of your loan regardless of whether your agency or service misses a payment. Additional information is available under [Repaying Your Loan](/loan-basics/repaying-your-loan/).
