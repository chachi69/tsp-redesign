**Approaching deadline for some uniformed services members** &#8212; Are you a member of the uniformed services who is eligible to opt into the Blended Retirement System, also known as BRS? The deadline to sign up is approaching fast. By December 31, 2018, you must choose whether to stay with your current retirement system or opt into BRS. A video, “Opting into the Blended Retirement System (BRS),” and a fact sheet, [_Questions and Answers about Opting into the Blended Retirement System (BRS)_]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspfs01.pdf), are available to help you make the important decision.
