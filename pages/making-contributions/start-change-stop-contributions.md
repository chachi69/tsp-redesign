# Start, change, or stop contributions

In most cases, you'll use your agency's or service's electronic payroll system to start, change, or stop your TSP contributions.

For example, civilian payroll systems include [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/Default.aspx){:target="\_blank"}, [myPay](https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx){:target="\_blank"}, [LiteBlue](https://liteblue.usps.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/z1/jY9NC4JAEIZ_SweP60zaF92kQxF9EGLaXEJhWxfWXdHV6N8ndSiir7m9M8888AJBAqTTVorUSqNT1eUDjY6zebAYjFeIW2-P6G2G4Q6j0Md1H-IbgB8mQKB__r8A9F0fA_1ClkBCmezeJtCZPxFAFT_xilduU3Xr3NqynjrooJKWZ6rhbsEfgSkjpGZGK6k5a-qyZi8nYVoH3-lzU1tInqxQFlGCjLLLOehdAUrfAgc!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/){:target="\_blank"}, EBIS, and [NFC EPP](https://www.nfc.usda.gov/EPPS/eplogin.aspx){:target="\_blank"}.

Uniformed services can use myPay (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps) or Direct Access (Coast Guard and NOAA Corps).

## I was just hired. Am I already contributing?

If you're a brand new employee of the federal government or uniformed services, you were automatically enrolled in the TSP at 3% of your salary. Many people who were automatically enrolled decide to increase their contributions to at least 5% of their salary to [get the full match](#) from their agency or service.
