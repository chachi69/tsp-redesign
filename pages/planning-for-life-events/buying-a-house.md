# Buying a house

If you’re planning to buy or build a new home, you might consider requesting a residential loan. But before you apply, read the TSP booklet, *[Loans]*(https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tspbk04.pdf). Remember that your TSP residential loan is not a mortgage, and your loan interest payments are not tax deductible as they might be for a mortgage or home equity loan.

## Residential loan documentation

When you request a residential loan, you must complete a *Residential Loan Agreement* and submit it, along with any required documentation, before your loan can be approved. This form documents the costs associated with the purchase or construction of your primary home.

### Documentation requirements
Documentation for all residential loans must show:
+ It’s from a third party or someone who is selling the home to you or building it for you
+ A date of no more than 24 months before the expiration date on the TSP Loan Agreement
+ You or your spouse as the purchaser or builder
+ Your purchase or construction price
+ The full address of the primary home you’re purchasing or building

### Special requirements
In addition to the requirements listed above, some types of primary residences require you to show further documentation. 
 
#### Cooperative purchase
When buying a cooperative, you must show that you own shares in a cooperative housing corporation.

#### New home construction purchase
When you’re constructing a new primary home, you must show evidence that a complete home will be constructed, such as:
+ Building permits
+ Building receipts
+ Other third-party documents

#### Mobile home or recreational vehicle purchase
When buying a mobile home or recreational vehicle as your primary home, you must provide all of the following:
+ Serial number or other identifying number
+ Complete description of facilities and accommodations (RVs)
+ Signed statement that the RV will be your primary home (RVs)

#### Boat purchase
When buying a boat as your primary home, you must provide all of the following:
+ Serial number or other identifying number
+ Letter from the marina or other location where your boat will be moored
+ Signed statement that the boat will be your primary home

### Changing your address
Once you’ve bought or built your new home, be sure that we have your new address on file. 
+ If you’re a current federal employee, contact your agency’s or service’s payroll office to change your address. 
+ If you’re an active duty uniformed services member, update your address through the MyPay website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.
+ If you’re no longer a federal employee, log into [My Account:Profile Settings](https://www.tsp.gov/tsp/login.html) and review and change the address listed there. Or while you’re logged in, use our online tool to complete Form TSP-9, *Change in Address for Separated Participants.* You can also fax or mail it to us.
