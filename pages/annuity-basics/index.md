# Annuity basics

Our annuity provides guaranteed monthly payments for as long as you are alive. Your annuity can also pay benefits to a survivor, or joint annuitant, if you want. Our annuity is one of the withdrawal options that are available to you once you leave federal service.

The annuity interest rate index is 2.625% for annuities purchased in May 2019 and 2.625% for annuities purchased in April 2019.
