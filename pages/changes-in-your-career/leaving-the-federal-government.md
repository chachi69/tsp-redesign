# Leaving the federal government

Did you know if your account balance is $200 or more, you can leave it in the TSP when you leave federal service?

Once you leave federal service, you’ll no longer be able to make employee contributions. However, you can keep more of what you save thanks to our low costs, change your investment mix, and transfer eligible money into your account — all while your account continues to accrue earnings.

As you prepare to leave federal service, here are four important things you must do:

- Make sure the TSP has your current address at all times.
- If you have any TSP loans, pay them off within 90 days of your separation.
- Read _[Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service](javascript:void(0))_ to fully understand your options.
- Read the tax notice "[Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account](javascript:void(0))."
