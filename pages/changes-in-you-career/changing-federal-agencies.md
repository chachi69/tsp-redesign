# Changing federal agencies

If you change federal agencies and you were previously contributing to the TSP, your employee contributions and, if youâ€™re FERS, your agency contributions will automatically resume.

If you were not previously contributing, you can begin at any time by following the instructions in [Starting, Changing, and Stopping Your Contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/making-contributions/start-change-stop-contributions/).

You should ensure that your new agency has your current address and you may also consider reviewing your contribution allocations to maximize your savings.
