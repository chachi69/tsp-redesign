Private parties offering assistance with your TSP account have not been approved, endorsed, sponsored, or authorized by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, the independent federal government agency that administers the TSP.

If you’re unsure whether correspondence or telephone calls claiming to be from the TSP are authentic, **DO NOT** provide any personal or financial information. Contact us directly at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to speak to a Participant Service Representative if you have questions or if you need to report any suspicious activity involving your TSP account.

Furthermore, you’re able to make online access to your TSP account even more secure by enabling two-step authentication at login. This means that you’ll receive a one-time verification code by email or text message each time you log into your account. To add this security feature, log into [My Account: Profile Settings]({{ site.myaccount }}/profileSettings.do?subaction=view&amp;_name=profile){:target="\_blank"}.

This two-step authentication login process is more secure because it means that online access to your account requires something you know (your account number or user ID and password) and something you have (the one-time code you receive in your email or on your phone). Someone who tries to log into your account fraudulently won’t be able to gain access without the code.

Before you can use two-step authentication, you must first validate an email address or cell phone. You can validate your contact information in [My Account: Profile Settings]({{ site.myaccount }}/profileSettings.do?subaction=view&amp;_name=profile){:target="\_blank"}.
