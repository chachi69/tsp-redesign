Lifecycle Funds Survey - The TSP is conducting a Web-based survey as part of our effort to produce a new Lifecycle Funds Educational DVD that will be made available to agencies for distribution. The few minutes that agency employees take to respond to our brief survey will help us to better understand their preferences and their approach to retirement investing. The survey has 25 questions and should take approximately 5 minutes to complete. It will be available for a limited time; therefore, we would like your assistance in getting the word out to agency employees. We would like you to participate as well.
