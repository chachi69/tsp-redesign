## Easier login and more security for <br />My Account this fall
You may notice some changes to your My Account login in late October 2020. As a stronger layer of security against fraud, all TSP participants will need to log in with a user ID and use a phone number for two-step authentication and other online requests.

If you already created a user ID and validated a personal phone number in My Account, you won’t need to make any changes. Otherwise, you’ll see prompts for the steps you need to take when you log in to My Account.

## Troubleshooting your login

### Helpful terms to know
- &#8220;Login verification code&#8221;—This is the code you use to log in with two-step authentication. This code expires after 10 minutes.
- &#8220;Validation code&#8221;—This is the code you use to validate an email or phone number. This code expires after one hour.

### Logging in with two-step authentication

  **If you selected an email address to receive your verification code,** first check your junk or spam folder. If you still can’t find the email, contact your email administrator or email service provider to find out about any delivery issues.

  **If you selected a phone number to receive your verification code,** make sure that you’re in a good service area. If the text message doesn’t arrive after 10 minutes, contact your carrier about any delivery issues.

  <div id="logging-2" class="usa-accordion-content" markdown="1">
  Only the most recent code you request will work. Make sure you’re looking at the most recent email or text message when you retrieve the verification code to use in My Account. If you aren’t sure which code is the most recent, or the code has expired, you can request a new code by beginning the login process again.

  You should also make sure that you’re using the correct type of code:

  - &#8220;Login Verification Code&#8221;—This is the code you use to log in with two-step authentication. This code expires after 10 minutes.
  - &#8220;Validation Code&#8221;—This is the code you use to validate an email or phone number. This code expires after one hour.

    My verification codes arrive too late.  
  </button>
  <div id="logging-3" class="usa-accordion-content" markdown="1">
  If your verification code doesn’t arrive until after the 10-minute expiration period, you won’t be able to use the code and will need to begin the login process again to receive a new code.

  Phone carrier network disruptions and a poor cellular connection are the most common reasons that a text message arrives late.
  For delayed email, you may want to check with your service provider or network administrator to find out if there are any known issues with email service. Sometimes, setting up automatic email forwarding from one address to another can cause delivery delays.

  <div id="other-2" class="usa-accordion-content" markdown="1">
  If you have two TSP accounts, you need to set up your contact information or passwords to either connect them in My Account or to keep your login information separate for each account.

  **How to set up your login information for dual accounts:**

  - If you have both a civilian and a uniformed services account, the TSP will use the same account number for both.
  - Set a **different** user ID and password for each account to access them separately.
  - Set the **same** user ID and password for each account if you want the ability to access both your accounts in a single session. When you log into My Account, you will be asked which account &#8212; civilian or uniformed services &#8212; you wish to access.

    Your IP address changed.
  </button>
  <div id="other-3" class="usa-accordion-content" markdown="1">
  For security reasons, the Internet Protocol (IP) address assigned to your computer or device must remain the same during your My Account session. Some network managers use security protocols to change IP addresses randomly for different online transactions, which can generate a browser-to-server authentication error.

  If you are accessing your account from a workstation connected to this type of network, your My Account session may end suddenly, and you may receive a message that your IP address changed. Try accessing your account from a &#8220;dedicated&#8221; IP address, or from one that won’t change during your session.

  To assist participants that use workstations connected to a .gov or .mil network with multiple security protocols, the Network Security Administrator for that Agency or Service should email the [TSP Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@tsp.gov?subject=TSP.gov%20IP%20Exception%20Request)for an &#8220;IP Address Exception.&#8221;
  </div>
</li>
</ul>

## Two-step authentication and validating contact information

### Two-step authentication helps prevent fraud.

All TSP participants must use two-step authentication to log into My Account. Two-step authentication helps you protect your account against fraud by prompting you for a one-time verification code each time you log in. This login process is more secure because it means that online access to your account requires something you know (your account number or username and password) and something you have (a one-time verification code you receive in your email or on your phone). Someone who tries to log into your account fraudulently won’t be able to gain access without the code.

### Set up two-step authentication by validating your contact information.

You must add and validate at least one email address or a phone number in order to use <span data-term="Two-step authentication" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">two-step authentication</span>. You may add and validate up to two email addresses and one phone number to your TSP account.

You can manage your contact information in the &#8220;Profile Settings&#8221; area of My Account after you log in. If you log in and haven’t yet enabled two-step authentication, you will see a prompt to validate an email or phone number before you access your account.

If you already have contact information in your account, you will see a label underneath each email or phone number that reads &#8220;Validated&#8221; or &#8220;Not Validated.&#8221; Select the &#8220;Validate&#8221; link for the contact method you want to validate. We will send you a validation code by email or text message, depending on the contact method you select. Enter the validation code in the appropriate field in your browser to complete the validation process.


## Tips for using two-step authentication

### Validate at least one contact method that will stay with you through career transitions, such as a personal email or personal phone number.

If you need to log into your email to retrieve the validation code, open a new tab or window to do so.

You must be logged into My Account in order to enter the validation code. You have one hour to use the validation code, but My Account will automatically log you out after ten minutes of inactivity. If you do need to navigate away from My Account or get logged out before you complete the validation process, you can use the link you receive with the validation code to log in again and complete the validation process.

### Consider validating two email addresses and a phone number.
When you log into My Account, you will see a prompt to choose the contact method you want to use to receive your login verification code. By validating multiple contact methods, you have more flexibility in how to access your account.

### Make sure your contact method is secure.
Your account is only as secure as your login credentials. Make sure you enable any additional security features, such as two-step authentication and passcodes, on your email accounts and devices.
