Employees who transfer to international organizations cannot participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) while they are employed by the international organization. This is true even if the employee continues to make contributions to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), the Foreign Service Pension System (FSPS), the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), or the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System (FSRDS), as authorized by 5 U.S.C. ยง 3582.
