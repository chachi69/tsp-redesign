# Being a beneficiary participant

If you’re the spouse beneficiary of a deceased participant's TSP account and your share of the balance is $200 or more, we’ve established a beneficiary participant account in your name. We’ll send you a "welcome letter" that provides your account and TSP benefits. Read it carefully and contact us immediately if any of your personal data included in the letter is incorrect.

As a beneficiary participant, you will not be able to make contributions to, borrow from, or transfer money into your beneficiary participant account (BPA); however, you can enjoy many of the same benefits as employee participants including:

- Low administrative expenses that can increase your savings potential
- Tax-deferred growth of earnings on traditional and Roth contributions
- Easy-to-understand [investment options](#)
- Staying in the TSP and choosing from several withdrawal options

To get the most out of the TSP, you need to make several important decisions about your account. Reading the booklet, [*Managing Your Account for Beneficiary Participants*](javascript:void(0)), will help you get started. For more in-depth information about your benefits and investment options, read [*Your TSP Account: A Guide for Beneficiary Participants*](javascript:void(0)).

## Combining your TSP accounts

If you have an existing TSP account from your own employment with the federal government or the uniformed services, you can move your beneficiary participant account (BPS) into your existing TSP account by completing Form TSP-90, Withdrawal Request for Beneficiary Participants. The money you move will be treated as an employee contribution, but it will not be subject to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) annual elective deferral limit. (See the instructions on Form TSP-90 for more information on combining accounts.)

In general, once you combine your BPA with your existing TSP account, your BPA money will be subject to the rules that govern the account to which it was moved.
If both accounts contain Roth contributions, the Roth Initiation Date that will apply to your combined account is the earlier of the two. If only one of the accounts contains Roth money, the Roth Initiation Date associated with that account becomes the date for your combined account.

But once you move your beneficiary participant account to your own account, the following rule also applies in order for your Roth earnings to qualify for tax-free withdrawal: You must be 59½, permanently disabled, or deceased.</p></div>

If your BPA resulted from a uniformed services TSP account and the account contains tax-exempt money from combat pay, those funds cannot be transferred into your civilian TSP account. In this case, the tax-exempt funds will be distributed directly to you. Check your quarterly or annual statements to see whether your BPA account contains tax-exempt money.

**Note:** You **cannot** move an existing TSP account into your beneficiary participant account. And if you have more than one beneficiary participant account, you cannot combine them. Also, if you have an IRA or other retirement plan, you will not be able to transfer or roll over those funds into your beneficiary participant account.
