## About TSP installment payments and life annuities

<span style="color: #cd2026">Change in Required Minimum Distribution Age:</span> The SECURE Act, which passed on December 20, 2019, changes the age at which you have to start taking required minimum distributions from 70&frac12; to 72. The law excludes people who turned 70&frac12; on or before December 31, 2019. We are awaiting guidance from the IRS on how this new law should be implemented. **Please be aware that this calculator has not been updated for the new law**.

If you're a separated or beneficiary participant, you have some options if you want to use your TSP account as a source of income to be received at regular intervals. You can elect to have TSP installment payments sent to you either monthly, quarterly, or annually; or you can use all or part of your TSP account to purchase a life <span data-term="Annuity" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">annuity</span>. Purchasing an annuity means that you pay now to receive monthly payments that last for the rest of your life or, if you purchase a joint annuity, your joint annuitant's life. (View Feature Comparison Chart).

This calculator estimates how a given amount of money might translate into monthly income, whether through TSP installment payments or through the various life annuity options. To make the comparison easier, the calculator only shows monthly TSP installment payments, since annuity payments are always monthly. Remember that quarterly and annual payments are also available.

Please note that annuity purchases are irrevocable. Be sure to read the &#8220;Life Annuities&#8221; section of the TSP booklet [_Withdrawing From Your TSP Account for Separated and Beneficiary Participants_](/publications/tspbk02.pdf) file for more detailed information.

Enter a rate of return if you would like your calculation based on an assumed annual earnings rate. If you enter 0% here, your monthly payment calculation will not include projected earnings.

**About rate of return**

The rate of return you assume for your account while you are receiving TSP monthly payments will depend on how you plan to have your account balance invested in retirement. If you guard all your retirement savings completely against volatility, the 5% rate of return that we show as an example may be unrealistically high.

On the other hand, as you are drawing down your account balance, you should be careful not to leave yourself exposed to a great deal of volatility. View the [Rates of returns]({{ site.baseurl }}/fund-performance/) for all the TSP funds and get an idea of how the funds have performed over time. Keep in mind that past performance is not a guarantee or a predictor of future returns. You might want to take a look at the L Income Fund, which is especially designed for participants withdrawing their TSP accounts in monthly payments. Its goal is to provide you a low level of growth with emphasis on preserving your assets.

**Dependent Qualifications**

A joint annuitant other than your spouse must be either a former spouse or someone with an &#8220;insurable interest&#8221; in you; that is, someone who is financially dependent on you and would derive financial benefit if you lived. (Generally, this is a blood relative or an adopted relative closer than a first cousin.) If this joint annuitant is more than 10 years younger than you, you will only be eligible for joint life annuity options with a 50% (not 100%) survivor benefit.
