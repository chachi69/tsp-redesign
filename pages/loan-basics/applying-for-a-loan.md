# Applying for a loan
Before you apply for a TSP loan, please review our booklet, [_Loans_]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/tspbk04.pdf). Be sure to read it thoroughly to make sure you understand all the rules and eligibility restrictions.

## Submitting your request
### Online requests
1. Complete your loan application by logging in to My Account. **Note:** Depending on your marital status,
the type of loan you are requesting, and how you want to receive your funds, you may need to take
additional steps to submit your application.
2. If the online tool prompts you to print and submit your loan request, you must open and print the loan
agreement package supplied to you, sign and date the form, include any additional required
information, and send the completed request to us. You can then upload your submission in My
Account, or you can mail or fax us your request according to the instructions on the form.
3. Submit this request one time only. We will cancel any subsequent request we receive.

## Spousal rules
By law, your spouse has certain rights to your TSP account. When requesting a loan, you must indicate if you are married, even if you are separated from your spouse.
+ FERS or uniformed services participants: Your spouse must consent to your TSP loan by signing the Loan Agreement that you print from [My Account]({{ site.myaccount }}).
+ CSRS participants: We must notify your spouse when you apply for a loan.

Exceptions to the spousal rule may be approved under very limited circumstances. For more information, please refer to Form TSP-16, [*Exception to Spousal Requirements*]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-16.pdf),  ([TSP-U-16]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/tsp-u-16.pdf), for uniformed services members).

## Residential loan documentation
When you request a residential loan, you must provide supporting documentation of the costs associated with the purchase or construction of your primary residence, before your loan can be approved.

### Documentation requirements
#### All residential loans

All of your documentation must
+ be from a third party (that is, someone who is selling the home to you or building it for you);
+ be dated no more than 24 months before the expiration date on the Loan Agreement;
+ show you or your spouse as the purchaser or builder;
+ show the purchase or construction price; and
+ show the full address of the primary residence.

#### Special requirements
In addition to the requirements listed above, some types of primary residences require you to show further documentation.

#### Cooperative purchase
Purchasing a cooperative requires you to show that you own shares in a cooperative housing corporation.

#### New home construction purchase
Constructing a new primary residence requires you to show evidence that a complete residence will be constructed, such as:
+ Building permits
+ Building receipts
+ Other third-party documents

#### Mobile home or recreational vehicle purchase
Purchasing a mobile home or recreational vehicle as a primary residence requires you to provide all of the following:
+ Serial number or other identifying number
+ Complete description of facilities and accommodations (RVs)

#### Boat purchase
Purchasing a boat as a primary residence requires you to provide all of the following:

## Loan processing
+ If you successfully complete the entire loan process online, and are approved, you will receive your money in 8 to 13 business days. If you submit a paper loan agreement, it may take several weeks.
+ You may track the status of your loan by logging in to [My Account]({{ site.myaccount }}) or by [contacting us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).

## Receiving your money

+ If your loan request was made and approved online, you will receive your money in the form of a check, mailed to the address we have on file for you. You will not have the option of receiving your funds by electronic funds transfer (EFT).
+ If your account is invested in more than one TSP fund, your loan payments will be deducted proportionally from the traditional and Roth contributions and earnings in each fund.
