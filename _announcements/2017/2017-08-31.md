TSP participants may now reset their passwords online. Participants who forget or lose their password can go to the [My Account]({{ site.myaccount }}) section of tsp.gov and reset it. On the My Account login page, they can click on “Forgot your password?” and follow the prompts. For participants who know their password and want to change it, they can log into My Account, visit “[Profile Settings]({{ site.profile_settings }}),” and click on “Change Your Password.” Participants may also call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778, Monday – Friday, 7am – 9pm EST and press option 3 to speak to a Participant Service Representative.
