# How to submit a Privacy Act request

You should use the processes outlined below if you wish to access or correct records that the Agency maintains about you. The entity you contact will vary according to the type of record you wish to access or correct.

- [TSP records](#tsp-records)
- [Non-TSP records](#non-tsp-records)

## TSP records

If you are a current Federal employee and wish to know whether you have a TSP account or have a question regarding your or your agency’s contributions or adjustments to contributions, contact your employing agency.

For all other inquiries regarding TSP records, you may choose from the methods listed below. The information you must include with your request and the information you are able to obtain will vary according to your status (e.g., TSP participant, spouse, former spouse or beneficiary) and the method you choose. The following information is available by phone and the TSP website: account balance; available loan amount; the status of a monthly withdrawal payment; the current status of a loan or withdrawal application; and an interfund transfer request.

## Non-TSP records

If you wish to know whether the Agency has non-TSP records about you, you may submit a written request to:

**FOIA/Privacy Act Officer**  
Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board  
77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000  
Washington, DC 20002  

Please include the name and type of records you are requesting; your full name and address; your Social Security number if you are an FRTIB employee; a brief description of the nature, time, place and circumstances of your association with FRTIB, and any other information you believe would help the Privacy Act Officer determine whether the system contains records about you. Please include the words “PRIVACY ACT REQUEST” on both the letter and the envelope.

Attorneys or other persons acting on behalf of an individual must provide signed authorization from that individual, such as a Power of Attorney, in order for the representative to act on their behalf.
