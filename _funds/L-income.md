Fund_objective: The L Income Fund’s investment objective is to achieve a low level of growth with a high emphasis on preservation of assets. Unlike the other four L Funds, the L Income Fund's asset allocation does not change quarterly. However, like the other funds, it is rebalanced daily to maintain its target investment mix.
questions:
  - question: Why should I invest in the L Income Fund?
    answer: You should consider investing in the L Income Fund if you are currently withdrawing money from your TSP account in monthly payments or you plan to begin withdrawing money before 2019.
  - question: Am I ok with market and inflation risk?
    answer: When you invest in the L Income Fund, you are subject to the investment risks associated with the G, F, C, S, and I funds. This means that the L Income Fund can have periods of gain and loss, just as the individual TSP funds do.
  - question: How can I use the L Income Fund in my TSP Account?
    answer: The S Fund can be useful in a portfolio that also contains stock funds that track other indexes. The C, S, and I Funds, for example, track different segments of the overall stock market without overlapping. By investing in all segments of the stock market (as opposed to just one), you reduce your exposure to market risk.

additional_info: |
  The L Income Fund is designed to produce current income if you are already receiving money from your TSP account through monthly payments or if you plan to withdraw or to begin withdrawing from your account before 2019. The asset allocations are based on the investment consultant’s assumptions regarding future investment returns, inflation, economic growth, and interest rates. We review these assumptions at least annually to determine whether changes to the allocations are warranted.

  Remember, however, that expected risk and return are based on assumptions about future economic conditions and investment performance. There is no guaranteed rate of return for any period, either short-term or long-term. For the fund’s historical returns, visit [Share Price History](). Past performance does not guarantee future results.
risks: |
  When you invest in the L Funds, you are subject to the investment risks associated with the G, F, C, S, and I funds. Your account is not guaranteed against loss. The L Funds can have periods of gain and loss, just as the individual TSP funds do.
rewards: |
  The L Funds simplify fund selection. You choose the fund that is closest to your target date (or, if your target date falls between the target dates that are offered, you can split your account between the two target date funds closest to your time horizon).

  When you invest in the L Funds:

  - You can be sure that your TSP account is broadly diversified.
  - You don't have to remember to adjust your investment mix as your target date approaches - it's done for you.
