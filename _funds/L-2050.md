additional_info: |
  The L 2050 is designed for you if your time horizon falls within the 2045 or later range. The asset allocation of this fund is adjusted quarterly, moving to a more conservative mix, gradually approaching that of the L Income Fund. Between quarterly adjustments, the asset allocation of the L 2050 is maintained through daily rebalancing to the fund’s target allocation.

  Remember, however, that expected risk and return are based on assumptions about future economic conditions and investment performance. There is no guaranteed rate of return for any period, either short-term or long-term. For the fund’s historical returns, visit [Share Price History](). Past performance does not guarantee future results.
