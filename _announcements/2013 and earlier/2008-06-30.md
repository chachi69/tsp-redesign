We have just made it easier for participants to access their accounts on the TSP Web site. Participants can now create Custom User IDs to use in place of their 13-digit TSP account numbers to access their accounts on the Web site. To do this, they will log into Account Access using their TSP account numbers and Web passwords, and then choose "Create/Modify Custom ID" from the Account Access menu. The custom ID is interchangeable with the TSP account number on the Web site - participants can use their custom IDs **OR** their 13-digit TSP account numbers, along with Web passwords, any time they log into their accounts.

**Note**: Custom IDs cannot be used on the ThriftLine. The TSP account number (and 4-digit PIN) remain the only way to access a TSP account on the ThriftLine.
