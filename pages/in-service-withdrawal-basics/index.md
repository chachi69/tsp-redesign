# In-service withdrawal basics

In-service withdrawals are withdrawals you make from your TSP account while youâ€™re still working for the federal government or a member of the uniformed services. An in-service withdrawal can have a __serious impact__ on your TSP account. Remember that the purpose of your account is to accumulate savings so that you'll have income during retirement.

## Things to consider:

+ Withdrawals permanently reduce your retirement savings as well as any earnings you would've earned.
+ Withdrawals may be subject to income taxes or other penalties.
+ If you're a married FERS participant or a member of the uniformed services, your spouse must sign a consent waiver for your in-service withdrawal.
