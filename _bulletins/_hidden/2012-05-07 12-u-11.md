The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Agency) has made a number of changes to the TSP age-based in-service withdrawal process to provide for notarized spouse and participant signatures and to reduce the number of forms rejected because they are incomplete or invalid. Changes include the consolidation of Forms TSP-75, Age-Based In-Service Withdrawal Request (Civilian) and TSP-U-75 (uniformed services) into a single form, effective May 7, 2012. The combined form supersedes all prior versions of the Age-Based In-Service
Withdrawal Request, with dates prior to April 2012. Previous versions of the form must be immediately discarded (recycled), and agencies/services that provide links to electronic versions of old forms should disable those links. Previous versions will not be processed after June 1, 2012. A copy of the consolidated Form TSP-75 is attached to this bulletin. It is also available for download from the TSP website.
