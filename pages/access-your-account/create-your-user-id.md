# {{ page.title }}

You must create a <span data-term="User ID" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">user ID</span> to log in securely to <span data-term="My Account" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">My Account</span>. If you previously created a user ID and can’t remember it, you may be able to [recover your user ID online]({{ site.baseurl }}/access-your-account/request-your-tsp-account-information/#user-id).

You need your **<span data-term="Account Number" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">TSP account number</span>** and **<span data-term="Password" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">web password</span>** to create your user ID.
